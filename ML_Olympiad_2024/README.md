# ML Olympiad 2024

This repository contains the solutions for the challenges I participated in as part of the ML Olympiad 2024. I'm proud to have participated in this competition, and I'm excited to share my work with the community.

## Challenges

### Predicting Earthquake Damage

This project is my submission for the "Predicting Earthquake Damage" challenge on Kaggle.

*   **Kaggle Competition:** [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-predicting-earthquake-damage](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-predicting-earthquake-damage)

The goal of this challenge is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by an earthquake, based on various building and location features.

To solve this problem, I built a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is a simple feedforward neural network that takes in the building features and outputs a prediction of the damage level. The notebook `Predicting_earthquack_damage/EarthQuake.ipynb` contains the code for this solution.

### The Turtle Vision Challenge

This project is my submission for "The Turtle Vision Challenge" on Kaggle.

*   **Kaggle Competition:** [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mlo2024mlact](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mlo2024mlact)

The goal of this challenge is to classify images of marine life, specifically different species of turtles and jellyfish, and to distinguish them from plastic pollution. This is an important task for marine conservation efforts.

For this challenge, I used a deep learning approach based on transfer learning. I used the pre-trained InceptionV3 model and fine-tuned it on the provided dataset. The notebook `Turtle_vision_challenge/TurtleVision_Challenge.ipynb` contains the code for this solution.

## How to Use

The code for each challenge is contained in a Jupyter notebook within its respective directory. To run the code, you will need to have a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, etc.).

Please note that the file paths in the notebooks may be hardcoded to my local machine. You will need to update these paths to point to the location of the data on your own machine.

## Conclusion

Participating in the ML Olympiad has been a fantastic learning experience. I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked on these challenging and meaningful problems. I hope that my solutions can be useful to others in the field.
