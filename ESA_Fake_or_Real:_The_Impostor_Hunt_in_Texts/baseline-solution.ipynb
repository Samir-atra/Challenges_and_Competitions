Here's the idea:\n\n1. **Detect Language**: We break the text into words and determine the language of each.\n2. **Calculate Proportion**: We then compute the percentage of English words in the entire text.\n3. **Assign Label**: The text which gets higher percentage of English words is classified as **Real** and its number is saved to the results list.\n\n---\n\n### 📦 Getting Started: Install & Import Required Packages\n","metadata":{"id":"28eb6402","papermill":{"duration":0.005901,"end_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:09.769223","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:09.763322","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"id":"9d4a1e72","cell_type":"code","source":"# !pip install langdetect\n!pip install pandas\n!pip install unicodedata2\n!pip install scikit-learn\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom langdetect import detect, DetectorFactory\nfrom langdetect.lang_detect_exception import LangDetectException\nimport unicodedata\n\nimport string\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nimport numpy as np\nDetectorFactory.seed = 42","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-22T19:14:18.254982Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-22T19:14:18.254522Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.250987Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.250005Z"},"id":"9d4a1e72","papermill":{"duration":4.005574,"end_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.253245","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:18.247671","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"b7b9ab10","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The following is an enhanced markdown description for the cell above, formatted for direct inclusion as a Markdown cell in a Jupyter/Colab notebook.\n\n\"\"\"\n# 🚀 Data Ingestion Function: `read_texts_from_dir`\n\nThis cell defines the **`read_texts_from_dir`** function, a critical utility for **efficiently loading and structuring raw text data** from a hierarchical file system into a clean pandas DataFrame. It acts as the initial ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) step for downstream NLP tasks.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Purpose and Functionality\n\nThe core objective of this function is to automate the process of collecting text files that are presumably organized in pairs within subdirectories (e.g., `data/doc_001/file_a.txt`, `data/doc_001/file_b.txt`, etc.).\n\n### Parameters\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **`dir_path`** | `str` | The root path to the directory containing all subdirectories with the text files. |\n\n### Process Flow\n1.  **Directory Pre-count:** The function first calculates the total number of subdirectories (`dir_count`) within the provided `dir_path` using `os.walk` and `os.path.isdir`. This is a **performance optimization** to pre-allocate the data structure (`data=[0 for _ in range(dir_count)]`), ensuring efficient memory usage as the list is populated.\n2.  **File Reading Loop:** The unselected portion of the code would then traverse these subdirectories, read the content of the relevant text files (likely two per subfolder), and create a list of records.\n3.  **DataFrame Construction:** Finally, this list of records is transformed into a pandas DataFrame.\n\n### Output Structure\nThe resulting DataFrame (`df`) is structured for comparative text analysis:\n\n| Column | Data Type | Meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **`id`** | *Varies (Int/Str)* | A unique identifier, typically derived from the subdirectory name, serving as a primary key for the document pair. |\n| **`file_1`** | `str` | The text content of the first document (e.g., the source text or prompt). |\n| **`file_2`** | `str` | The text content of the second document (e.g., the potential duplicate, response, or comparison text). |\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Application and Relevance\n\nGiven the output format (`file_1` and `file_2`), this function is highly relevant for common NLP and data science problems like:\n* **Plagiarism Detection:** Comparing a submitted document (`file_2`) against a source document (`file_1`). 🕵️\n* **Semantic Similarity/Paraphrasing:** Evaluating how closely the meaning of two texts aligns. 🤝\n* **Parallel Corpus Development:** Creating structured data for machine translation or text-to-text generation tasks. 📝\n* **ML Data Preparation:** Creating the input features and labels required for training models.","metadata":{"id":"b7b9ab10","papermill":{"duration":0.006209,"end_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.266228","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.260019","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"id":"f0a81296","cell_type":"code","source":"def read_texts_from_dir(dir_path):\n  \"\"\"\n  Reads the texts from a given directory and saves them in the pd.DataFrame with columns ['id', 'file_1', 'file_2'].\n\n  Params:\n    dir_path (str): path to the directory with data\n  \"\"\"\n  #

Loading:** The `dotenv` library is used with `load_dotenv` to securely load necessary environment variables, typically including the **Gemini API Key**, from a `.env` file for access by the
