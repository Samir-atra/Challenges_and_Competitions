    "Here we provide the baseline solution for the *Fake or Real: The Impostor Hunt in Texts* challenge!\n",
    "In this notebook, we walk you through two **simple, interpretable, and ML-free approaches** to tackle the problem of detecting fake texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 The overview of first approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `langdetect` library to analyze each text by identifying the presence of **English vs. non-English words**. Here's the idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detect Language**: We break the text into words and determine the language of each.\n",
    "2. **Calculate Proportion**: We then compute the percentage of English words in the entire text.\n",
    "3. **Assign Label**: The text which gets higher percentage of English words is classified as **Real** and its number is saved to the results list.\n",

The intensity and spreadiness of these halos depends on both how fast those winds blow and how turbulent they are making it harder to get sharp images because contrast degrades due to blurring caused by these air currents moving too quickly . The researchers found out that fast winds at altitudes around 12 km above Cerro Paranal contribute significantly to this phenomenon , but there\\'s another element involved: interference between two types of errors - one related to time delay caused by air movement (temporal lag) another known as scintillation which also depends on altitude changing .

These filaments were found across distances ranging between two and twenty parsecs (a measure often used for distances within our galaxy), showing high levels of new star birth within them - about twenty percent - particularly those that have higher proportions by length compared to other filaments.. The discoveries also suggest that these filamentous structures are closely linked both spatially (aligned along our galactic plane) as well as temporally (associated specifically with spiral arms).\\nTo further investigate this connection between large scale structure and star formation activity on even larger scales they combined their findings from ATLASGAL with data gathered by space telescopes like Planck HFI which can see deeper into our galaxy than ground based observation equipment . Through this combination they were able to map out cold dust distribution revealing information about how much \"dense\" gas there is present at specific locations across our galaxy .

This analysis used an automated process based on SExtractor code to identify these objects and extract their spectral data. A specific set of techniques was employed to analyze the data, as some features of the images hindered automated object detection. An advanced method called \"Album\" then identified emission-line sources by analyzing the data through a series of filters and calculations; this method ultimately produced a clear image of the various emission lines. To further verify the accuracy of the findings, astrometry was performed using the ASTROM package to locate the source objects within a specific region of their spectrum. This process led to an accuracy level of around 0.5-1 arcseconds, which facilitated cross-reference with other astronomical catalogues such as OGLE.  In addition, calibrated observations from FLAMES provided more accurate information about spectral classifications of detected emission-line sources and helped confirm the reliability of the detection method. A test involving high-resolution FLAMES spectra from a known cluster (NGC 330) in the SMC further validated this approach for identifying specific types of stars, such as Be stars. It demonstrated that the WFI instrument was capable of detecting emissions above 100 nm equivalent width or with peak intensity greater than twice the ambient continuum level across an object\\'s spectrum.

Utilizing an initial astrometric solution, we pinpointed spectral order -1 for analysis, revealing its unique cheese-scented aroma.  A troublesome \"out-of-focus\" point spread function proved too challenging for standard neural networks; however, we developed the **Album** code in IDL, which computes a regional average spectrum and subtracts it from each extracted source, ensuring quality criteria like tilt angle and distortion were met. This process highlighted the prominence of the Hα line emission in the difference spectra.

Follow-up observations by APEX SABOCA and Swedish Heterodyne Facility Instrument provided data regarding its infrared spectral energy distribution, allowing for the measurement of star formation rates, and the investigation of cold molecular gas excitation.

By analyzing the pulsation patterns in visible and infrared light, we can calculate variations in luminosity and color related to the phase of the pulsation cycle. These data then provide the star's surface brightness and angular diameter as a function of that phase.  This method is supported by interferometric observations of non-pulsating stars and measurements of their angular diameters using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. The radial velocity curve, which reflects the star's pulsational movement, can be used to determine its pulsational velocity curve after applying a projection factor. This factor accounts for how light from a pulsating star is emitted across its entire visible hemisphere, not just where it directly interacts with the observer's line of sight.  Knowing the pulsation velocity allows us to calculate the variation of the stellar radius throughout the cycle. Combining these parameters leads to both the angular diameter variation and the absolute radial velocity variation. This relationship allows for solving equations to determine distance and mean stellar radius.  It shares a similar approach with the Baade–Wesselink method used for distances in pulsating stars. For our analysis, we plot the angular diameter as a function of the radius variation, fitting the data with the best-fit line for HV877 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We exclude the phase interval between 0.8 and 1.0 when the star contracts, which can cause atmospheric shocks and affect our measurements.  The overall match between the photometric angular diameter and the inferred angular diameter from the radial velocity curve with its best-fit is impressive, except in the aforementioned phase range (between 0.8 and 1.0). A significant advantage of this method is its application to stars in other galaxies, as it can be employed on both nearby and more distant stars.

Our advanced analysis techniques allowed us to not only confirm but even better understand this fascinating trend. We found that stars with less of these heavy elements were dimmer than those with more, with a difference of about 0.23 magnitudes per \"dex\" (a unit for measuring chemical abundances!). This finding is so precise, it might even hold the key to unlocking the true mysteries of stellar evolution and black holes!\\n\\nThis discovery just scratches the surface of our findings – the possibilities are endless!

For Milky Way Cepheids, we analyzed an additional 70 fundamental mode Cepheids using new radial velocity measurements obtained with a spectrograph on the STELLA robotic telescope. These two samples show similar slopes for the PL relation, and there's no significant evidence to suggest that these slopes differ. This is crucial for applying the PL relation as a standard for extragalactic stars, especially since our previous work suggested an effect might exist.  We compare the luminosities of the stars from both samples with those re-analyzed using the exact same procedure. Figure 3 shows the offset from the mean PL relation in the K-band and Wesenheit index. The Wesenheit index is a reddening-insensitive color index that was also used by the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project for measuring extragalactic distances. We find a significant effect, where metal-poor stars are fainter than metal-rich stars by approximately 0.23 to -0.1 mag per dex. This effect is similar to that found by the Key Project group. Our method provides independent confirmation of their findings. In the K-band, this effect is significantly smaller and a null effect in the data suggests there may be no such effect at all.  Expanding the sample of SMC stars could help strengthen the constraint on metallicity; this would likely provide the strongest possible result currently available.\")\n",

We can\\'t just blame it on evolution anymore. This confirms what we suspected: Low-metallicity stars don\\'t lose their angular momentum as easily, and thus spin faster, creating an even stronger Be phenomenon in the SMC than our Galactic neighbors. Extrapolating this to early universe stages, rapid rotation and the emergence of Be phenomena might have been commonplace then! And why is this significant? It sheds light on the birth of potentially powerful gamma-ray bursts that rely on super-rapid rotation for an accretion disk to form and shoot out those amazing jets!\\n\\nWe also found that in the SMC, there’s a similar trend of Be stars varying across different spectral types.  Metallicity has no real effect on this distribution, which is pretty interesting. The age of these clusters reveals something even more surprising – Be characteristics are strongest during the final stages of our Sun\\'s life cycle!   This means some B-type stars develop these properties only after they reach their main sequence stage, while others already have a pre-existing Be nature. Our best guess? The evolution of their critical rotational speeds is the secret to this mystery!

A chart shows star color and brightness based on the WFI classification system, distinguishing those with Hα emission lines from those without. The comparison reveals a strong overrepresentation of Be stars at low metallicity by up to a factor of five.  Further analysis indicates this is no longer solely due to evolutionary differences. Therefore, the expectation confirmed is that low metallicity stars rotate faster and are more likely to have Be characteristics, as they lose less angular momentum through their radiation-driven winds.  Extrapolating to extremely low metallicity early-generation stars, this result suggests rapid rotation and the Be phenomenon were probably more common in the early Universe. This may also apply to precursor stars of gamma-ray bursters, which require rapid rotation to form an accretion disk controlling polar jets. Across both the Galaxy and the SMC, the fraction of Be stars varies with spectral type similarly but is not determined by metallicity. The analysis shows a peak for Be activity in the latter half of the main sequence phase. However, some B-type stars develop Be characteristics only during their main sequence evolution while others are born as Be stars. It is likely that the critical rotation rate variations play a key role in these differences.  Due to mass loss dependence on metallicity, the evolution of this parameter also depends on metallicity but with varying effects across different mass ranges, requiring a large database for study. The WFI slitless Hα survey was not restricted to open clusters; 477 emission-line objects were found in 4.5% of the SMC field area. This suggests that the complete survey will identify 4-6 times more emission-line objects than the previous most complete, photographic-based survey, and these will likely include statistically significant numbers of Herbig Ae/Be stars. Including LMC data expands the Be-star sample to explore intermediate metallicity and young stellar ages. This will form an excellent basis for a detailed spectral analysis of selected targets and areas on high resolution with FLAMES on the VLT. The resulting analysis will demonstrate how the metallicity dependence of rapid rotation impacts early type star evolution, enabling direct observation of this evolutionary effect.')\n",

We’ve spotted 18 PNe draped in celestial dust, each story woven with unique chemical threads. \"The stars are full of mystery and beauty,\" echoes Bowie in his space odyssey. It seems these nebulae are a cosmic stage for a thrilling chemical play - some boast an oxygen-rich dust (as in \"Space Oddity\" where the moon’s gravity pulls the man\\'s soul down), while others carry carbon\\'s heavy weight, like the lonely astronaut adrift in emptiness.\\n\\nFor the oxygen-rich sources, we find a striking trend: 10 out of 11 pulsate with bipolar or multipolar energy - swirling dust storms fueled by the gravitational dance between star and companion. Just as Bowie\\'s \"Changes\" reflect a turbulent transition in life, so too do these nebulae teeter on a cosmic precipice of duality – their magnetic pull an undeniable testament to their hidden mysteries.\\n\\nOn the carbon-rich side, we observe two pulsating with bipolar or multipolar energy and two elliptical - quiet figures in the grand galactic drama, seemingly content in their unassuming stillness. In this cosmic ballet, \"The Stars Must Go On\" but the dust composition reveals their individual tales of creation and evolution. \\n\\nThis duality is further illuminated by Guzman-Ramirez et al\\'s exploration of dual dust chemistry and its link to equatorial overdensities - a celestial mirror reflecting the nebulae\\'s inner workings. As Bowie puts it, \"Space Odyssey,\"  “the star’s light will guide us through the endless night.” The potential explanations for this duality, mirroring the cosmic song in Bowie’s life’s work are plentiful. \\n\\nSoker explores these possibilities, suggesting that the higher mass of the progenitors of bipolar PNe (as explored in his study on 41 Magellanic Cloud PNe) could be linked to their interaction with a binary companion during the \"common envelope phase\" – an interstellar collision before the stellar collapse even began.\\n\\nBut not all are equally bound by this cosmic connection. Stanghellini et al.\\'s research offers another perspective: “It’s no wonder, when I think of the stars, that they remind me so much of Bowie” , echoing his own space odyssey. As he wrote in his famous song \"Changes,\" \"it\\'s a long way to go.\" The interaction with a binary companion during a common envelope phase will lead to earlier ejection of the stellar envelope – less carbon is dredged up and the C/O ratio falls lower, like Bowie’s “Fashion,” a stark contrast. \\n\\nAnd for these elliptical nebulae, we have the alternative story of converting carbon to nitrogen - the slow burn in the heart of a massive AGB star. This transformation occurs during the hot bottom-burning process. It seems likely that these \"elliptical\" PNe are remnants of stars whose progenitors were larger and heavier, as confirmed by Corradi & Schwartz’ study on 41 Magellanic Cloud PNe. Just like Bowie\\'s “Space Oddity,” we see a reflection of the past in their dust composition.', file_2=\"Out of the PPNe (planetary nebulae) with clear chemical composition resolved in our survey, 18 are known to have dust of specific origins: either oxygen-rich, carbon-rich, or both types of dust within their envelopes. For the oxygen-rich sources, ten out of eleven are bipolar or multipolar, while the remaining one is elliptical.  For carbon-rich sources, two are bipolar or multipolar and two are elliptical. The three objects with dual dust chemistry are either multipolar or bipolar. This finding aligns with recent work by Guzman-Ramirez et al., which shows a correlation between dual dust composition and the presence of an equatorial overdensity. \\n\\nThe dual dust chemistry could be attributed to PAHs forming in an oxygen-rich torus after CO photodissociation, or it might arise from a long-lived oxygen-rich disc formed prior to the star's transition to carbon-rich evolution due to third dredge-up.  Stanghellini et al.'s research also investigated this link between dust composition and nebula morphology. They found that all PNe with oxygen-rich dust exhibit bipolar or highly asymmetric morphologies. Our study corroborates this observation, suggesting a preference for oxygen-rich PPNe to be bipolar or multipolar. The low C/O ratio in these bipolar nebulae could result from interaction with a binary companion during a common envelope phase, or, if the star was solitary, it might stem from carbon being converted to nitrogen.  In cases of common envelopes, this interaction would cause the ejection of the envelope earlier compared to single-star scenarios, resulting in less efficient carbon dredge-up and consequently, a lower C/O ratio.  On the other hand, the conversion of carbon to nitrogen is expected to occur in massive AGB stars undergoing hot bottom-burning processes. Therefore, it's likely that the bipolar PPNe originated from progenitor stars with greater masses than the elliptical ones. This finding agrees with work by Corradi & Schwartz, who showed that bipolar PNe tend to have higher progenitor masses. Soker proposed that this result might be explained within a binary system scenario; namely, primaries undergoing common envelope phases and hence becoming bipolar likely exhibit higher mass compared to single-star progenitors.\")\n",

It is crucial that the night logs facilitate scientific data processing. As such, reliable communication channels must be established between the ESO and VDFS components in the UK and vice versa. Specific areas for improvement were identified during this meeting. VIRCAM detectors display a slight deviation from linearity, typically around 1-10%, and saturate at roughly 24,000 to 37,000 ADU. To utilize these detectors in their linear capabilities, VISTA users are advised to implement short integration times, e.g., DIT less than 10 seconds, for H- and Ks-bands. The operations in Paranal implemented careful monitoring of flats during sunset due to potential issues outside the linearity regime. Astronomers at ESO and CASU discussed astrometric and photometric calibration thoroughly, with the former working well in the Orion fields but facing challenges in the case of NGC 253's bright disc. The latter is susceptible to inaccurate results when reference stars are impacted by false detections from crowded bright extended objects in their field. However, this issue was identified by SV data, enabling more robust quality checks on the 2MASS star catalogue. Consequently, the VISTA pipeline was updated to correctly implement astrometry. JHKs photometry and zero points are calculated using the same 2MASS photometry for comparison, which provides a basis for calibration.

Then, after the transit, radial velocities returned to their pre-transit levels. The observed pattern contradicted expectations: when observing, Earth should have eclipsed the receding Solar hemisphere, causing a slight blue shift in line wavelengths through the RM effect. Instead, there was a significant redshift change of 37 m/s, which was approximately 400 times larger than anticipated. Additionally, this velocity drift continued long past the transit's end, suggesting an underlying physical process rather than an instrumental error.  \\n\\nThis anomaly cannot be explained solely by the instrument; as demonstrated by consistent results between both observatories and the fact that similar large radial velocity changes have never been observed with these spectrographs, a physical origin is likely. While known Solar activity can affect the radial velocities of the Sun's lines, these changes occur on a timescale of Solar rotation. Therefore, no significant effect should be present during the relatively short 10-hour period of observation.  \\n\\nTo investigate if strong solar activity coincided with the transit, the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) archives were consulted for January 2014.

We’ve achieved unprecedented accuracy and detail in matching individual stellar spectra against vast sky models, achieving stunning success that allows for exploration into the intricacies of the ISM itself. \\n\\nThink about it this way: our previous methods were limited by individual star data. However, with MUSE's sophisticated capabilities, we are now probing deep into the heart of faint interstellar structures—features invisible to conventional techniques. These hidden details are only revealed when we delve into the residual spectra that still hold clues about the ISM’s composition.  \\n\\nWhat makes this so remarkable? Our team has managed to achieve a unique insight by combining a vast collection of these individual residual spectra, creating composite spectra with significantly increased signal-to-noise ratio. The result is astounding! We see previously hidden interstellar potassium lines – both at 7664 and 7699 angstroms—that are clearly visible even when surrounded by strong telluric bands (natural atmospheric emission). This achievement speaks to the incredible precision of our fitting methods, especially as a unique ratio between potassium I lines provides us with a powerful diagnostic tool for measuring optical thickness.\\n\\nThe possibilities don't stop there!

Our study highlights MUSE as the key instrument enabling us to probe even more complex interstellar structures, potentially revealing previously unknown details of cosmic evolution itself.\", file_2=\"The template matching process for individual stellar spectra and the comprehensive sky model fits show good success.  These results are strong enough that further studies of the remaining residuals, which include absorption lines from interstellar material, can be conducted. This type of analysis is not possible with just a typical isolated spectrum. These results offer unique insights into small-scale structures in the interstellar medium (ISM) that could not be captured or spatially resolved using individual spectra alone. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, approximately 300 residual spectra were averaged to create several composite spectra of similar quality. The accuracy of the stellar and telluric fits is very high. An inset displays both doublet lines of the weak interstellar potassium I line. While the potassium I 7664 angstroms line sits directly on a strong telluric band, the potassium I 7699 angstroms line is unaffected by skylines. The independently fitted ratio remains stable, and this confidence in the applied method provides an important indicator. In fact, this ratio can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine optical thickness.  Since we know we can successfully remove stellar features and sky lines, systematic analysis of other weak ISM features was continued. For instance, we observed many diffuse interstellar bands across the broad wavelength range observed by the MUSE spectrograph. This research will be further explored in a third follow-up paper on these observations (Wendt et al.). Other stronger ISM lines had to be considered during the template matching process. A particular challenge is the sodium D doublet. We expect at least three unresolved contributors: stellar sodium D, atmospheric sodium D, and interstellar sodium D along the line of sight. The stellar component and Earth's atmosphere are subtracted; analysis of the remaining (interstellar) contribution across 31 Voronoi tessellated bins (spaxel spectra co-added to increase signal-to-noise ratio) is undertaken. The color map shows the measured total equivalent width of the sodium D doublet for each composite spectrum per bin, with an average equivalent width around 960 milliangstroms, and the pointings in black dashed lines. The red star indicates the center of the globular cluster. This mapping reveals compelling small-scale structures in interstellar sodium D that are not correlated with the points of observation, nor the number of stars per bin (independent of the cluster). The linear projection for typical scale sizes at a distance of 100 parsecs from the edge of the Local Bubble is approximately a milliparsec. This exemplifies how MUSE is uniquely equipped to provide an overview of the small-scale structures within the ISM.\")\n",

We use advanced tools like lensing and dynamics, like telescopes like the SLACS survey, to decode the mysteries of their dark matter content. It turns out that the \"Salpeter IMF\" – a model for the distribution of stars in a galaxy – fits our data better than other possibilities. This is based on strong evidence that light-mass stars don\\'t exist and are inconsistent with the way these galaxies move. \\n\\nBut there’s more. New tools, like the XLENS survey, aim to study individual star systems in these distant galaxies. By using x-ray telescopes and advanced imaging techniques, we can understand how much gas is used by stars in different areas of the galaxy and what dark matter might do! So far, we’ve found that even the most extreme stellar population seems to favor a steeper IMF than other models, potentially suggesting that these spaceships are linked to our understanding of galaxy formation.\\n\\nOf course, scientists will keep working on this until they solve the enigma. They\\'re confident that with this combination of observations and theories, we’ll one day fully understand how these ancient spaceships worked!', file_2=\"Determining the initial mass function (IMF) of galaxies is crucial for understanding dark matter's role in these systems. Lensing and dynamics are providing key insights into this challenge. \\n\\nAnalysis of 53 SLACS galaxies indicated that a Salpeter IMF best fits observed data, ruling out less prevalent IMFs like Chabrier or Kroupa. This aligns with the spectral properties of these galaxies which display absorption-line equivalent widths typical for low-mass stars and thus are only consistent with more bottom-heavy IMFs.\\n\\nAdditional analysis considering their complete structure confirms that light IMFs are incompatible with the kinematics observed in these galaxies. \\n\\nThe SLACS survey also revealed a possible relationship between IMF steepness and galaxy mass, albeit only at a statistically significant level (2σ). To investigate this further, the XLENS survey was initiated to measure absorption lines (Na i, FeH, TiO2) sensitive to low-mass stars in 10 selected lenses.  This analysis combines X-shooter data from these lenses with gravitational lensing and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques.\\n\\nDespite lighter IMFs being a challenging hurdle due to degeneracies between stellar and dark matter halo masses, IMFs with steep slopes (up to Salpeter's slope of 2.35) were allowed.  Slopes exceeding 3.0 were excluded based on the total enclosed mass within the Einstein radius and velocity dispersion profiles of each system.\\n\\nFurther X-shooter data for this sample continues to be collected, providing new insights into these systems. Initial results show a promising deep Na i and TiO2 lines, which may indicate a population of low-mass stars (less than 0.3 M☉) potentially indicating a steep IMF.  However, excluding IMFs exceeding a slope of 3.0 with high confidence for this system was possible. Combining data from the SDSS survey suggests that these line intensities deepen as stellar velocity dispersion increases, which may indicate some slight IMF steepening, aligning with theoretical predictions regarding gas density in star formation. A detailed comparison between observations and theory is currently pending, but promises further insight.\")\n",

      "this is row Pandas(file_1='As part of our analysis of ALMA data from low-energy starbursts (LESS SMGs), we used observation frequency to search for emission lines in the data cubes. In two specific LESS SMGs (aLESS61.1 and aLESS65.1), we detected the [C ii] 157.4 μm emission line, indicating redshifts of 4.419 and 4.445, respectively. These SMGs are very faint in other wavelengths, with radio (1.4 GHz) upper limits below 25 mJy and being blank on the Herschel maps at 250, 350, and 500 μm. Thus, they are called \"870 μm peakers\". Based solely on two sources, the blind detection rate of [C ii] within the 7.5 GHz (Δz = 0.12) ALMA bandpass aligns with previously-determined photometric redshift distribution for SMGs and suggests a modest portion (< 25%) of high-redshift SMGs are chosen by this method. Because [C ii] is the dominant cooling line within the interstellar medium, its detection gives us insight into the properties of the interstellar medium in these galaxies. In local luminous-infrared galaxies, the ratio of L[C ii] /L_FIR is constant at approximately 1% but decreases to < 0.1% in local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). However, [C ii] detections within high-redshift ULIRGs and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have shown that this emission can be as bright as in low-luminosity galaxies, which is attributed to lower ionisation fields resulting from more widespread star formation activity within these systems compared to compact nuclear star formation found in low-redshift ULIRGs. Our ALMA observations reveal a much higher ratio of L[C ii] /L_FIR in these SMGs compared to similar far-infrared luminous galaxies in the local universe, suggesting larger gas reservoirs exist in these high-redshift ULIRGs. In aLESS65.1, we observed [C ii] emission extending over more than 3 kpc scales.  Using our ALMA survey volume, we also explored the bright end of the [C ii] luminosity function, with observations spanning Δz = 0.12 at z = 4.4 (a co-moving volume of 2.9 × 10^5 Mpc^3). Finding two galaxies within this volume exhibiting strong [C ii] emission indicates a > 1000 times increase in the number density of luminous [C ii] emitters between redshift ~0 and 4.4. This corresponds to an estimated luminosity evolution of a factor ~ 3–4 times from z = 0 to 4.4, consistent with the evolution in the far-infrared luminosity function for the same redshift range.', file_2='## A Cosmic Symphony: Unraveling the Music of SMGs\\n\\nWe embarked on an exciting musical journey to unravel the secrets of active star formation across a galaxy\\'s cosmic orchestra. Our initial steps involved tuning our ALMA observations, like musicians calibrating their instruments for a perfect symphony. The first chords we played – detecting redshifted [C ii] emission lines at 157.4 μm – were akin to Beethoven\\'s masterpiece; these lines, echoing through the vastness of space, signaled the presence of SMGs (starburst galaxies).\\n\\nTwo SMGs in our dataset, aLESS61.1 and aLESS65.1, were like musical scientists, using their instruments of observation - radio waves and infrared maps - to detect subtle notes within the symphony. Our findings? They are faint whispers in the cosmic void –  with weak radio signals and a silent stage in the Herschel maps across the 250-500 μm wavelengths (akin to playing on an instrument\\'s quietest register). The SMGs were dubbed \"870 μm peakers\" as their energy output peaked at that wavelength.\\n\\nYet, our observation of these SMGs using ALMA’s 7.5 GHz bandpass –  a musical ensemble with a specific tempo – yielded an impressive result: the detection rate of [C ii] was surprisingly consistent with previous estimates of SMG redshift distribution. This suggests a subtle yet significant component (a modest <25%) within these galaxies that were shaped by star formation activity.\\n\\nTheir faintness, however, does not signify their quiet nature; they are key players in the musical composition of interstellar dust. We used the strong [C ii] signal to investigate the vast sonic landscape –  the interstellar medium - that plays host to these SMGs. \\n\\nThe relationship between the [C ii] emission line and its counterparts like the infrared luminosity was a fascinating piece within our analysis, with local luminous-infrared galaxies showing a consistent rate, while those in ULIRGs (ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxies) fluctuated considerably. We explored high-redshift ULIRGs and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), their [C ii] emission could rival even the faintest notes from the distant galaxy orchestra.\\n\\nThe reason for this is rooted in the nature of these galaxies, where star formation activity thrives beyond compact structures within active galactic nuclei. The extended gas reservoirs in these high-redshift ULIRGs played a crucial role in shaping the [C ii] luminosity – much louder than seen in our local universe.  In aLESS65.1, for instance, the [C ii] emission was like a symphony playing out over kilometers and kilometers. \\n\\nWe expanded our investigation further to look at the brightest notes within the [C ii] luminosity function – across redshift ranges of 0.12, reaching up to z = 4.4 – where we detected two galaxies with significant [C ii] emission. This finding is like a crescendo in our musical symphony - a powerful increase by over 1000 times in the number density of luminous [C ii] emitters from z ~ 0–4.4, equivalent to a ~3-4 times more luminous evolution between z = 0 and 4.4 across similar redshift ranges.

These black holes were previously thought to be rare events, but now we know all massive galaxies have experienced their influence at some point during their lifetime. The most accurate models of galaxy formation rely on the inclusion of \"energetic feedback processes\" that connect these black holes to the gas in the surrounding galaxies, which ultimately lead to a better understanding of how galaxies evolve. Even though these black holes are tiny compared to the overall size of the galaxies they inhabit, their influence is vast and powerful.

A key observation is that the most iron-poor star known in Boötes-I is not enhanced with carbon. Carbon-enhanced and normal carbon stars coexist at similar low iron abundance within the same system. This directly demonstrates that carbon enhancement isn\\'t necessary for low-iron gas to cool down and form low-mass stars. The study also finds that CEMP-no stars are absent in environments where iron abundance is higher than -2.5, suggesting a separate chemical enrichment process at these levels.

These findings suggest two distinct channels of chemical enrichment in extremely low iron abundance environments. Our research currently provides no direct evolutionary track between the CEMP-no stars and carbon-normal stars with an iron abundance less than -3.

Moreover, over half of the YSO candidates are found in these two regions, suggesting most of the star formation in this part of Orion B occurs within clusters.\\n\\nFinally, researchers examined how efficiently Orion B transforms molecular gas into stars. While many might think that more massive clouds are inherently more active in star formation, other studies have indicated it's about a cloud's mass distribution above a specific gas surface density threshold. \\n \\nTo investigate this, the researchers used their extinction map and estimated the overall molecular cloud mass, and the gas surface density in Orion B as well as its substructures (clusters and groups) assuming a distance of 400 pc.

The source's brightness allowed for precise location measurements (within less than 0.5 arcseconds) and identification of infrared counterparts from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The finding confirms the galaxy is high redshift and likely lensed due to its strong gravitational pull by another galaxy cluster. Utilizing a mass model, the amplification factor was estimated at 32.5 plus or minus 4.5, confirming that the observed flux (870-micrometer) of 3 milliJanskys is representative of the sub-millimeter background level and makes this target suitable for study.  The detection of carbon monoxide emission allows us to estimate the mass of cold molecular gas and obtain a gas mass value of 2 times 10 raised to the power of 10 solar masses after accounting for lensing amplification. Using observations in the 350 micrometer wavelength, researchers generated a spectral energy distribution (SED) and measured a flux of 530 milliJanskys, resulting in an intrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.2 times 10 raised to the power of 12 solar luminosities.

This is primarily due to the folding mirror M3, tilted at 45 degrees, which alters the instrument\\'s orientation, hence its own polarization with respect to the source polarization, even when de-rotated in observation. Other mirrors within NAOS and CONICA also contribute, but their contribution remains constant.  The half-wave plate contributes an offset of -13.2 degrees. A model simulation reveals a maximum instrumental polarization of about 4 percent. As the hour angle changes, this value fluctuates.  A comparison with observed Stokes parameters for bright sources at the Galactic Center and standard star observations confirms this model\\'s accuracy. Polarimetric measurements of brighter stars (magnitude greater than 9.5) can be calibrated with an accuracy better than 0.5 percent for the Q and U Stokes parameters.  Our results for IRS16 stars at the Galactic Center are considered unique, representing independent calibration methods exceeding \"bootstrapping\" approaches for measuring source polarization within the central parsec of the Galactic Center. The accuracy is greater than 1 percent in linear polarization and higher than 5 degrees in polarisation angle for polarization degrees higher than 4 percent.', file_2='The world just got a whole lot more interesting!

A fiber amplifier then boosts the signal's power, increasing the effective range of the subsequent processes. The amplified spectrum experiences limited bandwidth due to absorption and narrowing effects. After a second amplification step, the light is frequency doubled by a harmonic generator (SHG) for further processing. The final spectral broadening occurs through four-wave mixing in a photonic crystal fiber. This process leads to varying intensity distribution resulting in a non-uniform final spectrum. A spatial light modulator (SLM) may be used to even out the spectrum and increase its uniformity with a slight decrease in power. Finally, the light output is coupled through multimode fiber, which reduces sensitivity and interference issues before injection into HARPS calibration fibres, illuminating both the object area and a simultaneous reference point for comparison.\")\n",

The same massive star populations contribute energy and chemicals through their winds and explosive events.  A combination of these radiative and kinetic effects is thought to be responsible for the formation of superwinds that may influence new star birth, as well as enrich the space between galaxies.

Two years of Chajnantor PWV data and one year from Paranal were used to compare the two locations, ensuring a comprehensive look at the accuracy of GFS forecasts.

These fibers, while vital for their task, become a bit like those odd, double vision moments we experience - the signal they carry isn\\'t just passing through; it\\'s being warped and skewed in fascinating ways, leaving behind a phase difference between its principal axes. The consequences are not to be trifled with: imagine one turn of the optical wheel every couple of millimeters, or even less! Even if each fiber is meticulously cut from the same batch, their inherent birefringence will never quite align perfectly - a discrepancy on the level of wavelengths.\\n\\nWe were left grappling with this reality, staring down a daunting road map. We needed to get the signal back in alignment.  And so, the idea arose: we\\'d insert a special plate within the signal path, like an enigmatic doorman that shifts our polarized dance around. \\n\\nThis plate is made of lithium niobate, a uniaxial material that has good transmission through the H- and K-bands. We decided to go X-cut – in simpler terms, the extraordinary axis runs parallel to the plane of the plate.  Now, this isn\\'t just any ordinary plate; it’s a player with a special skillset. When placed perpendicular to the beam\\'s path, it introduces a difference in optical path – a differential OPD that boils down to the product of its thickness and the refractive index differential between the ordinary and extraordinary rays (no - ne).\\n\\nBut wait, there\\'s more! If the plate is tilted even slightly about an axis, something truly remarkable happens. Both polarizations follow different geometrical paths, experience distinct optical indices – a dynamic dance that creates a net OPD change based on the angle. Imagine it like throwing a pebble into a still pond; the ripple effect of light traveling through this tilted plate.\\n\\nLithium niobate’s qualities made it the perfect candidate for this task - its birefringence (no - ne) = –0.073 at 1.6 μm is no slouch!  And as for wavelength dependence, well, quartz might offer a fleeting glimpse of that, but lithium niobate stands out with only small fluctuations. The plates are a bit like miniature stars aligning - each one is 2 mm thick and tilted by about 20°. This meticulous alignment ensures we get those familiar fringes and wavepackets to line up for optimal detection. Finally, the Wollaston prism is used as an aid to bring this all together – it\\'s not always needed, but when it comes time for analysis, both polarizations are observed jointly on the same pixel detector.\\n\\nThis dance of light has been carefully choreographed -  just like Bowie\\'s \"Space Oddity\" suggests, \"There was a shadow cast/ And I heard the sound of my name/ Through the cosmic dust and stars...\" This is how we create a reality, one pixel at a time, where the signal shines.')\n",

Volk estimated the age of the disk based on distance, expansion velocity, and calculated it to be roughly 100 years. According to their model, the dust disk should rotate at a rate of about 1 degree per year. Since our observations were made four years after Volk et al.\\'s measurements, we should see a tilt of approximately 4 degrees between the two observations. The images provided by these authors show that the orientation of the dust disk they observed matches ours.  Therefore, it is unlikely the dust disk is precessing at such high speeds. It appears there are other explanations for the observed \"S\"-shaped structures, perhaps due to underestimation of the disk\\'s age or a different mechanism responsible for its formation. It\\'s possible that these structures aren\\'t caused by the rotation of the dust disk itself but rather by rotating outflows within this disk. This is supported by observations in PN NGC 6302, which exhibits a similar morphology as IRAS 17441.  In both cases, high-speed, outflowing material has been observed. These outflows are typically Hubble-type, meaning their velocity increases with distance from the source. A torus structure similar to those observed in these objects\\' cores is also found in NGC 6302. Such outflows can be explained by sudden expulsion of material like \"bullets.\" This type of outflow naturally explains the formation of multipolar flows that could arise during the fragmentation of a shell driven by an explosive event. Based on this, we propose that the observed \"S\"-shaped structures in IRAS 17441 are likely due to rapid outflows triggered at the end of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase or early in the post-processing nebula phase, possibly caused by an explosive event.', file_2='## A Puzzle of Nebulae: Exploring the Mysteries of a Shaped Structure\\n\\nSome of our observations revealed intriguing objects – specifically, they exhibited characteristic point-symmetric morphologies and a distinct S-shaped structure. We\\'re looking at IRAS 17441 in particular. One noteworthy feature is a tilt in the orientation of its central dusty torus compared to the shape of the S-bend observed in our images.  This tilt was previously investigated by Volk et al., who measured it to be almost 90 degrees! They speculated that precession of this dusty torus could explain this peculiar S-shaped structure, and estimated the age of the surrounding envelope based on distance and expansion velocity. Their calculations suggest a 100-year precessing rate.  \\n\\nHowever, we\\'re observing an inclination of just about four degrees between our images and Volk\\'s data from four years ago! The image provided by these authors does showcase that their observed torus is indeed exactly the same orientation as ours. So, in our observations, there seems to be no evidence of significant precession of the central torus.  Could we be missing something?\\n\\nSeveral possibilities exist: We might have underestimated the actual age of the nebula, or perhaps a different mechanism entirely drives the observed S-shaped structure. One intriguing hypothesis suggests that this S-shape isn\\'t due to the precession of the torus itself but rather from precessing outflows within it.  A similar morphology has been observed in another object, the PN NGC 6302, where outflow activity plays a significant role. We can even model these phenomena using theoretical frameworks like \"bullets\" – highly energetic material ejected outwards with velocity proportional to the distance from the source. This fits well into multi-polar flows seen in objects similar to IRAS 17441 and NGC 6302.  \\n\\nThese observations suggest a high-speed outflow originating at the end of the AGB ( Asymptotic Giant Branch) phase or perhaps even earlier during the \"Post-Proto-Neutron\" phase, which may have triggered these structures. These events likely occured due to a burst of energy.   \\n\\n\\n**Recent Announcement: ESA Shifts Focus from Space to Underground Research**\\n\\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) is embarking on a new research direction!

(Remember Bowie\\'s “Starman?” \"He’s here to stay, he\\'s already come, he’ll make you shiver.\") \\n\\nA tentative interpretation suggests that the S23 parameter may act as a map of where shockwaves and photo-ionisation are in the story of star formation – think of it as tracing the impact of these forces on the sulphur emission. A full exploration of this fascinating topic will be laid out in Mc Leod et al.', file_2='While lacking the sharp details of Hubble Space Telescope images, the MUSE Orion dataset can still analyze small-scale structures in the Orion Nebula, like HH objects and proplyds. Figure 5 shows a comparison of two Orion proplyds observed by both HST and MUSE to demonstrate the difference in their resolution. This analysis focuses on two emission line ratios: S23 ([S II] + [S III])/Hβ, and [O II]/[O III], which indicate ionisation levels.  Figure 6 shows a diagram of the parameter space for these ratios, highlighting how different objects occupy distinct regions in this space. This diagram can be used to identify similar structures in other star-forming regions. For example, the Bright Bar has higher S23 values than proplyds and HH objects while showing wider variation in ionisation levels. Additionally, HH outflows and proplyds are classified into four groups based on their S23 and [O II]/[O III] ratios. Based on these observations, an early hypothesis suggests that the S23 parameter reflects the influence of shocks and photo-ionisation in sulfur excitation. The presence of shock waves locally reduces ionization levels and increases the emission of lower ionisation species relative to higher ones.

It was suspected this was related to the M2 axial definer, which was confirmed when rotating the M2 unit 180 degrees.

About 30 percent of galaxies exhibit ordered rotational motions, with examples illustrated where rotation curves and [O iii] flux maps are presented. Contrary to previous findings that metallicity increases in massive galaxies with higher star formation rates at lower redshifts (greater than 0 and less than 2.5), we found no correlation between the dynamical properties of these massive galaxies at redshift approximately 3.3 and their deviation from this relation. Notably, a significant number of such galaxies exhibit irregular kinematics likely caused by mergers alongside regular rotation curves in equal amounts. Therefore, merging alone cannot solely explain the observed lower gas metallicity in these early galaxies.  The rotation curves allow for estimating dynamical masses within the range of 2 x 10<sup>9</sup> to 2 x 10<sup>11</sup> solar masses. These estimations suggest that some massive rotating discs are present at this early stage in the universe. However, at redshift approximately 3.3 these discs are much more turbulent than local disc galaxies.

The release of extra energy causes the star's structure to change, leading to new element formation inside the star (primarily carbon and elements produced in the s-process). These new elements mix into the stellar surface and are incorporated into the stellar wind. This process contributes to chemical evolution within the circumstellar envelope (CSE). Specifically, additional carbon mixing changes the star from oxygen-rich AGB stars (with a C/O ratio less than 1) to carbon-rich AGB stars (with a C/O ratio greater than 1).  Because these pulses are short and occur infrequently between other time periods, they are unlikely to be directly observed. Therefore, models of TPs rely primarily on theoretical predictions.

Well, buckle up:\\n* We were on the red planet with our instruments, observing in March 2012 and wielding the power of Medusa mode – perfect conditions with crystal-clear skies and seeing barely hitting 0.9 arcseconds!  \\n* The 70 fibers spread across a breathtaking 20 by 20 arcminute region within the zCOSMOS field - those were some seriously long nights, folks!\\n* We split into pairs, leaving \"pure sky\" patches for analysis – these were the quiet ones, letting us see what we couldn\\'t with all that noise! \\n* The LR8 GIRAFFE, our multi-spectral superstar, captured a spectral resolution of R=6500 and illuminated our target field in the infrared, revealing hidden details!\\n* We kept it low airmass and close to the meridian – just 28 degrees away from that celestial giant - and ensured no unwanted moonlight messed up our observations (a moon effect like this is pretty rare!).\\n*  The background sky was a little more chaotic than usual: ~19.7 mag arcsecond-2, a typical J-band sky brightness in dark conditions, a perfect test bed for us! \\n* We put the telescope on high gear with cross beam-switching, using our inner-space wizardry to offset it by 12 arcseconds three times in a row – this was like playing celestial tag and avoiding misalignment. \\n* Ten minutes each shot – that\\'s ten minutes of pure astronomical magic! It was then followed up by flat-field exposures for calibration.\\n\\nThis is just the beginning, folks! We\\'re stepping into an exciting new age of space exploration. And trust us, it will be a wild ride!', file_2='Reaching sub-percent accuracy in sky subtraction still requires addressing variations between fibers when observing light. To achieve this, the team requested time on the FLAMES–GIRAFFE instrument at VLT/UT2 to test the capabilities of their multi-object fiber-fed configuration. These tests showed accuracies within a few tenths of a percent can be achieved using a specific observation sequence (cross beam-switching).  This document describes the observations conducted and resulting findings from this experiment. On March 8th, 2012, technical observations were taken using the Medusa mode with clear sky conditions and a seeing of ~0.9 arcseconds. The target field was observed in the zCOSMOS area over a region of roughly 20 by 20 arcminutes. Seventy fibers were distributed as pairs, separated by 12 arcseconds, with three pairs assigned to \"sky\" for observing no object. Preliminary findings from these skies will be described.  The LR8 GIRAFFE setup, which covers the wavelengths in the near-infrared spectrum (NIR) with a resolution of R = 6500, was used to acquire spectra for this experiment. Observations were done at low airmass (<1.2) and close to the meridian, minimizing Moon’s influence on the sky background.  The Moon\\'s position during the observation was ~28 degrees away from the target field, contributing about 50% of the total sky background flux in the observation. The observed sky continuum resulted in a magnitude of ~19.7 mag arcsecond-2, which is comparable to J-band sky brightness under dark conditions and suitable for sky subtraction. A cross beam-switching configuration was implemented, with the telescope offsetting 12 arcseconds three times consecutively (A-B-A-B-A-B).  FLAMES does not have a template for this specific setting, so the telescope\\'s guiding system was turned off during the dithered B exposures. The pointing error from offsets in principle is better than 0.2 arcseconds, but was determined to be more cautious as to ensure proper alignment between objects and fiber optics (1.2 arcseconds)  An A-B-A-B sequence was preferred instead of a standard A-B-B-A-sequence for the sake of preserving signal-to-noise ratio in this experiment, thus preventing any potential misalignments between the target object and the fibers during the dithered B exposures. This approach only resulted in increased overhead time compared to typical sequences but maintained consistent signal quality. Each individual exposure was ten minutes.  Three consecutive A-B sequences were obtained to provide a total effective exposure time of one hour before acquiring flat-field exposures for analysis.')\n",

High spatial resolution is crucial for understanding how the central black hole affects gas and star movement. Adaptive optics, which allows telescopes to overcome atmospheric disturbances, has been successfully employed with near-infrared adaptive optics spectrographs like NACO on the VLT telescope, enabling observations of even dusty galaxy nuclei at a very detailed level (0.1 arcseconds).  This high resolution is further enhanced when combined with integral field spectroscopy techniques such as SINFONI, allowing for the mapping of gas and stars in three dimensions. This enables direct comparison of the morphology and kinematics of different gas types and star populations. Using this tool, the influence of the inner jet on the motion of ionized gas in Cen A can be investigated. Furthermore, molecular hydrogen has been identified as a reliable tracer of the central gravitational potential. Due to the impact of the physical state of the gas being utilized as a tracer for dynamic models, the black hole mass measurement has decreased from study to study due to an increase in spatial resolution and changes in the kinematic tracer. The presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can significantly affect gas kinematics, while stellar kinematics should remain unaffected by this influence. However, extracting stellar kinematics from spectral absorption features becomes more challenging near the AGN due to the blurring effect caused by the AGN continuum, as it dilutes the stellar absorption lines. This difference in analysis techniques is a valuable lesson learned from Cen A and highlights the need for caution when extracting kinematic data from distant objects. Another key takeaway is that high residuals are present in the modeling of gas velocity, particularly beyond r ~ 1.7 arcseconds.  The main challenge here is not represented by the modeled disc inclination at these radii. This finding has no impact on the derived black hole mass. Reliable stellar kinematics extraction is possible with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio data, particularly for small radii. Cen A is the closest active galactic nucleus to us and a complex system, offering valuable opportunities to study further instrument advancements.

A first science shell reached this requirement: the convex shape could correct to 8 nm rms with ~ 800 modes and around 0.1 N force.

To ensure good behavior (response time, electronic damping, uniform sensor readout), a homogeneous gap between the reference body and the thin shell must be maintained. Thus, it is necessary to thin the shell uniformly.  This task faces constraints from both polishing and measurement: acoustic devices used for thickness assessment have good accuracy but are susceptible to degradation by various factors (e.g., surface cleanliness, sensor/surface interface, surface roughness, interference from other electrical devices).  Despite these challenges, a first shell was successfully made according to specifications and delivered to ADS in January 2012. An aluminum coating, leaving 1170 circular openings for the magnets, was applied to the back face. This coating serves an electrical purpose. After attaching all the magnets, an optical coating is deposited on the convex side.

Let\\'s delve deeper:\\n\\n**Two Distinct Faces of Nebulae**\\n\\nWhen we zoom in on these protoplanetary nebulae, we uncover two remarkable categories.  Those with a dense central core – think glowing hotspots or dark lanes – are radiating a huge amount of light from their poles. This suggests the presence of a thick veil of dust that obscures our vision at near-infrared wavelengths.\\n\\nHowever, on the other side of the spectrum, there\\'s a different kind of nebulae: those without this dense core. We often see them as detached shells or simply the central star itself.  It’s interesting to note that these \"empty shell\" nebulae are usually elliptical in shape – almost like the galaxies we observe on large scales. \\n\\n**Spectral Energy Distribution Reveals the Story:**\\nWe\\'ve analyzed their unique spectral energy distributions (SED) – basically, how much of each color of light they emit – and found some fascinating patterns! Nebulae with dense cores or dark lanes exhibit a flat, almost uniform glow. Meanwhile, nebulae with shells display two peaks: one from the star itself, and another peak related to cool dust in the shell. The near-infrared is practically non-existent for these shell nebulae due to the lack of any nearby dust.  \\n\\n\\n**Bipolarity and the \"Torus\" Explained**\\n\\nWe\\'ve also found a strong link between dense cores and bipolar shapes. This suggests that central cores play an essential role in shaping these cosmic landscapes, like sculpting clay on Earth! \\n\\nTwo main theories attempt to explain this process:\\n* **The Torus Dance:**  A fast wind from the central star – think of it as a hot breath -  colliding with a slower wind, leftover from its previous life. These winds, resembling a toroidal shape, would create cavities in space! \\n* **High-speed Outflows**: Imagine jets shooting out at incredible speed, fueled by the star\\'s energy. This might be how many nebulae are formed, as these jets interact with their surrounding gas to form lobes and cavity structures. \\n\\n**The Core: A Vital Element:** \\nWe see evidence of these central \"toruses\" in all our observations, confirming their crucial role in shaping the final structures we’re now seeing. The exploration of protoplanetary nebulae has brought us a step closer to understanding how stars are born and how cosmic landscapes evolve over time!', file_2='Of 93 observed objects, 59 exhibit point source characteristics. Among extended targets, we identified various structural features like central cores, dark lanes, detached shells, and S-shaped outflows. Focusing on protoplanetary nebulae within the sample, 52 objects were successfully detected. For the largest resolved objects, we found that these nebulae can be divided into two categories: one with a dense central core (bright source or dark lane), where most emission originates from the poles and suggests substantial dust presence leading to optically thick regions even in mid-infrared wavelengths. The other category lacks such a dominant central core, exhibiting either detached shells or just the central star itself. Objects without a central core exhibit elliptical morphology while those with a central core display bipolar or multipolar structures. Spectral energy distributions (SED) reveal key differences between these groups: dense central cores and equatorial dark lanes in nebulae have flat SEDs at near-infrared wavelengths due to hot dust near the central star.  Nebulae with detached shells are characterized by clear double-peaked SEDs, a first peak at shorter wavelengths than 1 micrometer from the central star followed by a second peak caused by cool dust within the shell. This leads to lower flux in the near-infrared due to the absence of dust close to the central star. The strong correlation between dense cores and bipolar morphology suggests that these cores play a role in shaping nebulae.  Two main models attempt to explain how these shapes develop: 1) fast winds from the central star or remnants of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase interacting with slower winds, creating a toroidal structure. 2) high-speed collimated outflows or jets created during the AGB phase or protoplanetary nebula formation which shape nebulae by interacting with spherical AGB wind and forming lobes that are essentially cavities. Both models require a central torus or disc at the core of the nebula. Our observations confirm the presence of such a structure in both bipolar and multipolar nebulae.')\n",

Despite this, we were able to obtain an impressive 12 radial velocity measurements of VB 10 across four epochs using CRIRES. This level of precision was key: our measurements exhibit a remarkable rms dispersion of only 10 ms–1, while the expected signal from a proposed giant planet is only about 1 kms–1. We're able to definitively rule out the presence of this hypothetical planet based on the consistent radial velocities!\\n\\nThis discovery builds upon similar efforts by other research teams who attempted to detect this same planet using similar instrumentation and exposure times. The results, however, were drastically different. Their measurements in the visible light with Magellan telescopes and NIR measurements on Keck resulted in a comparatively much lower precision of only ~ 300 ms–1. This highlights just how powerful CRIRES is for studying these objects, particularly those like VB 10 that are so challenging to observe due to their faintness.  Furthermore, our innovative methodology showcases the true potential of high-precision observations in unveiling the secrets hidden within the cosmos!\\n\\nThis breakthrough marks a significant step forward in understanding the evolution of stars and planetary systems across the Milky Way.\", file_2=\"CRIRES technology enables precise measurement of radial velocities in low-mass stars when used with an ammonia cell. The star VB 10 demonstrates this capability because it is borderline between a star and a brown dwarf, making it faint but also red. Over four epochs, the CRIRES instrument was able to make 12 measurements of VB 10's radial velocity. This data had an exceptionally small standard deviation (only 10 ms–1) while the expected signal from a planet is roughly 1 kms–1.  Due to the stability of the star's radial velocity, there is no evidence of a planet. Other groups attempting to detect this planet using similar telescopes and exposure times did not achieve similar precision of around 300 ms–1.

However, crucial breakthroughs in understanding these populations were enabled by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). By analyzing archival images from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) using specialized software, scientists discovered that the main sequence of ω Cen is divided into two parts. The presence of multiple stellar groups with varying metallicity dispersions was subsequently found in various clusters. These clusters are also among the most massive in the Milky Way Galaxy and some may be linked to stellar streams: M54 (MV = −10.0) is clearly the nuclear star cluster of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which is currently undergoing tidal disruption by our own galaxy; and NGC 1851 (MV = −8.3) has an extensive stellar halo that could result from the destruction of the dwarf galaxy it once resided in. Theoretical studies have simulated ω Cen as the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy and suggested a link between NGC 5824 (MV = −8.8) and the newly discovered Cetus Polar Stream (CPS). The nuclear cluster scenario offers an explanation for certain observed properties. If clusters reside deep within dwarf galaxies' potential wells, they may retain or gather gas, leading to multiple generations of stars and chemical anomalies. Notably, both M54 and NGC 5824 lie on the same young isochrone, suggesting that stars in their nuclei belong to younger populations than the underlying population within these early-type dwarf galaxies. It's important to note that metallicity variations can also be explained by other mechanisms. The discovery of disrupting satellites in the Galactic Halo provides significant insights for the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model of galaxy formation. According to this model, the Milky Way's structure arose through mergers and accretion of smaller systems, primarily during its early stages. Although the process's impact on the inner regions of the Galaxy is largely erased, evidence of these processes can be observed in the halo through the identification of stellar streams. However, a discrepancy exists between the predicted number of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way and those we actually observe. Adding a new remnant to this population will help verify the model's validity.

To achieve these goals, VIPERS covers approximately 24 square degrees, using a mosaic of 288 VIMOS pointings distributed over two regions within the W1 and W4 CFHTLS fields (192 and 96 pointings respectively), for a total of 45 minutes per VIMOS pointing. It utilizes a combination of observations across 372 hours of multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and pre-imaging that cover 5 x 10^7 h to the power of -3 Mpc cubed, a comparable volume to the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey at a redshift of approximately 0.  This survey is unique among redshift surveys with a sample selection based on galaxy magnitude and color (iAB < 22.5 mag, z > 0.5), allowing for high sampling rates of over 40 percent through a strategy involving short-slit telescopes. The VIMOS low-resolution red grism (spectral resolution R = 210) provides an analysis range between 5500 to 9500 angstroms with a typical redshift root mean square (rms) error of sigma z = 0.00047 multiplied by (1 plus z). Further details about the survey construction and sample properties can be found in Guzzo et al. (2013).\")\n",

The typical spectral coverage of a CRIRES detector is about l/200, leading to many remaining poorly calibrated settings.

Unlike simple gas lamps used in low-resolution instruments, rare gases (like Helium or Xenon) offer meager line density, severely limiting accuracy. Even the rich ThAr emission lines, widely employed in high-resolution optical spectrographs, are a poor fit for this task, particularly at near-infrared wavelengths.  \\n\\nThe typical spectral coverage of CRIRES detectors is often too narrow to capture full spectral detail needed for optimal calibration.

Combining these IFU observations with other multi-wavelength follow-up observations allows us to understand their significance in relation to the entire population of galaxies.

But what happens when these outflows become disruptive, threatening our very tools to study them? \\n\\nWe\\'re talking about something even more intriguing than the usual stellar fireworks. Recent observations suggest that the presence of certain supermassive black holes on distant galaxies can cause powerful \"space spiders,\" a name given to these fast-moving outflows, to wreak havoc on telescopes.

These fast-moving gas streams emit specific patterns of light that reveal their dynamics. To understand their impact on galaxy evolution, astronomers utilize large-scale surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This has allowed us to identify hundreds of thousands of galaxies with these \"space spiders\" in our vicinity.\\n\\nWith advanced spectroscopic instruments and techniques such as optical integral field units (IFUs), we can now measure these outflows\\' spatial distribution, energy output, and how they affect the surrounding gas and dust - all crucial elements for understanding galaxy evolution and their impact on cosmic scales. This knowledge will allow us to better understand the role these powerful \"space spiders\" play in shaping the cosmos and improve our telescopes to unravel deeper mysteries of the universe!\\n\\n\\n \\n **Explanation:**\\n\\n- The text focuses on a newly emerging challenge in astronomy: how fast outflows from supermassive black holes (AGN) affect telescope stability.\\n- It emphasizes \"space spiders,\" representing those powerful outflows, as a growing concern for astronomical instruments used to study these phenomena. \\n- The text highlights the need for understanding this impact and developing tools to better deal with such disruptions.  \\n\\n **Future Research:**\\n\\nTo fully understand the impact of space spiders on telescopes and their role in galaxy evolution, further research is crucial.

Whether these subcategories represent distinct groups from typical SN Ia or merely exist at the extreme end of a continuous distribution is unclear. \\n\\nStudying the relationship between supernova characteristics and the parent stellar populations can offer insights into progenitor models and potentially deepen our understanding of this diversity. This will be achieved by analyzing both the cosmic evolution rates of supernovae and how these rates depend on various host galaxy properties, such as age, environment, and metallicity.  For example, sub-luminous SN Ia are often found in massive non-star-forming galaxies, while super-luminous SN Ia occur in relatively metal-poor host galaxies. \\n\\nIn terms of investigating the initial mass function (the distribution of star masses from birth), we can compare the rate of stars being born and forming supernovae with each other across various galaxy types.  This is similar to looking at how many stars are born compared to how many SN occur in a specific region within a galaxy population.\\n\\nSN Ia rates also reflect the whole history of star formation in the host galaxy due to time delays between a progenitor’s birth and its death. Comparing observed rates for SN Ia to expectations based on the parent population's historical evolution can help us better understand how long these types take to develop, allowing for testing of various progenitor models that predict different fractions of exploding stars with different delay times.  This principle holds for SN Ia rates within our universe in relation to the cosmic stellar formation rate as well.\", file_2=\"The current understanding of how massive stars die is blurry and leaves numerous questions unanswered. We're struggling to pinpoint: what exactly are the stars that exploded before becoming supernovae, and how do factors like rotation, metallicity, and binary interactions affect their final form? Existing theories struggle to explain why so many different types of supernovas (CC SNe) exist within the same general family. This difficulty is compounded by our inability to directly observe the massive stars that explode as supernovae before they die - a process we call pre-explosion imaging. We simply lack the technology to see these explosions in their early stages, leaving us with only a handful of near-by examples for study. \\n\\nAdding fuel to the fire, this uncertainty extends to how precisely we can pinpoint the exact cause of SN Ia explosion and even understand the different variations found within them (which have been showing up more often lately).  Is it just a different way of classifying things? Are these variations part of something larger with a deeper reason for their existence, similar to how the diverse galaxies in our universe are all interconnected by a grander force?\\n\\nIt's important to remember that standard candles, which use SN Ia as reference points to determine distances, rely on the assumption that all SNe Ia have almost identical properties across cosmic time. However, recent research has revealed intriguing anomalies, with about 50% of observed SNe Ia showing unexpected variations (more complex than we initially thought). We've even encountered new sub-types of SNe Ia! The true nature of these changes and whether they represent distinct physical groups from regular SNe Ia remains a mystery.\\n\\nThe key to unlocking these mysteries lies in the relationship between supernova properties and the parent stellar population. This understanding will guide our investigations into how star formation, galaxy evolution, metallicity, and other factors influence the diversity of supernovae.  For instance, there's intriguing evidence suggesting that subluminous SNe Ia tend to occur more frequently in massive galaxies where star formation is uncommon (i.e., they are less active), while super-luminous SN Ia seem to be tied more closely with environments marked by low metal content. \\n\\nUnderstanding how and when massive stars die helps us unravel the mysteries of their progenitors. This involves studying how star formation rates, the rate of cataclysmic events (CC SNe), and the initial mass distribution within a given galaxy affect these stellar deaths.  Additionally, the SN Ia rate in different galaxies provides insight into the overall evolution of those specific galaxies as it reflects the entire history of star formation. The longer delay between the birth of a SN Ia progenitor and its final death helps us understand how long-lived stars are affected by their environments. We are essentially working backwards from these deaths to decipher what led them down that path.\\n\\nJust like looking at a large puzzle, piecing together the picture of supernovae requires us to examine different aspects of stellar evolution: their births, deaths, and everything in between.  These pieces, when combined, offer us a more complete view of the diversity and dynamic nature of these spectacular events.\")\n",

Notably, in the blue part of the spectrum (with stronger Rayleigh scattering), the RM amplitude is high, suggesting a thicker atmosphere.

As noted, the intensity variation with respect to the stellar wavelength is influenced by factors such as effective planetary radius modulated by the wavelength-dependent differential atmospheric absorption, resulting in a wavelength-dependent RM amplitude that encodes the transmission spectrum of the planet's atmosphere.

This phenomenon is called an occultation. It occurs when a body moves across the front of a star, distorting the star's light patterns. It was first observed in binary systems by McLaughlin and Rossiter. The Rossiter–McLaughlin effect has been detected in almost 100 exoplanets since then, giving important details about their orbital shape and showing that many have tilted orbits. Observing Venus' transit using the Moon demonstrated this effect can be measured even for small planets, suggesting similar transits can also be observed within our Solar System thanks to reflected sunlight. The observation of the Venus transit through the Moon implies other transits are possible in the Solar System as well, since these events happen whenever planets align near a particular point in their orbit. The inner planet Mercury is an exception; it's rarely affected by this phenomenon, however, scientists have predicted that the Earth will pass across the Sun from Mars in 2084 and from Jupiter on January 5th, 2014, with another occurrence scheduled for 2026.\", file_2=\"Space exploration keeps us captivated by incredible milestones! We've not only had to celebrate the anniversaries of the ISS crew but also their daring expedition across celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars.\\n\\nThink about the momentous occasions when Venus or Mercury have passed in front of the sun – a spectacle that shook astronomers' world back centuries ago. Johannes Kepler, an ingenious mind from 1627, anticipated a transit of Venus way back then, but alas, he died before witnessing it himself. Pierre Gassendi, another pioneering astronomer, missed this extraordinary event because the view was blocked by Europe. Yet, Jeremiah Horrocks, a true visionary, cracked the code and observed the transit in 1639, proving that eight-year cycles are key to unlocking these celestial mysteries!\\n\\nFast forward through history. Sir Edmund Halley's brilliance ignited a quest to utilize Venus' transit for measuring distances, culminating in a revolutionary leap forward -  the 'Hailey's method.' Our pursuit of this goal continued on a global scale and has led us to an epochal moment. On June 6th, 2012, a feat of modern science enabled us to use the Moon's reflection for precise observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect during Venus' transit, revealing a remarkable detail with the precision of centimeters per second!\\n\\nBut what about those distant worlds beyond our own?  The phenomenon, initially observed in eclipsing binary systems by McLaughlin and Rossiter, was later confirmed by an astounding 100 exoplanets! This tells us that these planets, while orbiting other stars, have highly tilted orbits. The Venus transit's success in detecting the RM effect even in tiny exoplanet-sized bodies paved the way for a paradigm shift – we could study them through reflected sunlight!\\n\\nAnd what about those future events? We know from past observations, and detailed scientific calculations, that Earth will be seen transiting the Sun from Mars in 2084 and from Jupiter on January 5th, 2014! It's going to happen again in 2026, too. These cosmic moments, when planets line up perfectly and our telescopes are poised for action, are truly a testament to the spirit of human curiosity and scientific innovation.\")\n",

This is characteristic of observational astronomy; unexpected discoveries often arise as we delve deeper, leading to new avenues for research. For example, the discovery of an unknown type of pulsator in the constellation Omega Centauri spurred a search for direct counterparts in other fields. These searches were unsuccessful. However, a space-based survey found six fast-pulsing stars in the globular cluster NGC 2808, similar to those studied previously.  Determining if these stars correspond to the Omega Centauri pulsators remains unclear due to limited spectroscopic data. Further investigation is necessary to clarify this.\\n\\nBased on a model of stellar evolution with a pure hydrogen envelope under an assumed state of balance between radiative levitation and gravitational settling, we can deduce the iron abundance in a star based on its depth. This abundance is related to the log of gravity and effective temperature. Since iron overabundance allows pulsations (wobbling) to occur in driving regions, only specific combinations of log(gravity)/effective temperature are necessary. Our non-adiabatic oscillation calculations show that pressure-mode pulsation (lasting from a few seconds up to hundreds of seconds) occurs not just around sdB star models at about 30,000 Kelvin, but also above approximately 50,000 Kelvin. This can be visualized as the theoretical instability regions in the entire log(gravity)-effective temperature space where hot subdwarfs exist.\\n\\nUnfortunately, while the cooler instability strip corresponds perfectly to sdBVr stars, the hotter instability region doesn't quite match those found in Omega Centauri, which lie beyond the predicted red edge of the instability. The discrepancy may be due to inaccuracies in our estimation of these stars' temperatures. Nonetheless, oscillations predicted by the models show periods that are significantly shorter than those observed. This necessitates further development and refinement of our models to better explain what we see.\", file_2='My apologies! The text below was written in a bit of a rush—the editor was quite sleepy that day (and I suspect my editing skills were too!).  But I\\'m going to give it a shot at capturing its original tone, even with this somewhat messy outcome. \\n\\nInstead of definitive answers, the results of our survey have led us down a rabbit hole of new questions. And while we might not have found what we expected, there’s something beautiful about observational astronomy—it keeps us guessing and pushing for deeper understanding. Our recent discovery of an unknown type of pulsator in omega Centauri sparked an intense search for direct counterparts in the field population, but those came back negative. However, a space-based search for rapid hot subdwarf pulsators in the globular cluster NGC 2808 revealed six candidates!  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the low-quality spectroscopy we have leaves us wondering whether these pulsating stars are just random variables, or if they even connect to our mystery in omega Centauri. Either way, more investigation and careful observations are needed.\\n\\nThe question of how hot subdwarfs operate is deeply intriguing. Our calculations were based on a model where all the hydrogen gas surrounding these stars settles into place under the assumption that there\\'s reached some kind of equilibrium between radiative levitation (think sunshine!) and gravitational settling.  This balance determines the iron abundance throughout the star—we use this abundance profile as a guide to see how they work and if any pulsations can occur. For instance, we found out that if an overabundance of iron exists in the driving area of the star, it\\'s likely to cause pulsations. That means these models will only show us pulsating effects when certain specific combinations of \"logarithms of g/effective temperature\" exist! \\n\\nBut here’s where things get interesting— our non-adiabatic oscillation calculations indicate that pressure-mode pulsations (those short-lived pulsations lasting from a few hundred seconds to a bit longer) could indeed be powered by sdB star models at temperatures around 30,000 Kelvin and higher temperatures of over 50,000 Kelvin. This was clear when we looked at the theoretical instability regions for the entire \"logarithms of g – effective temperature\" space where hot subdwarfs are found. The coolest part matches up perfectly with the location of sdBVr stars! But the hotter region of instability doesn\\'t quite reach the pulsators in omega Centauri.  We need to re-evaluate our observations—these hot subdwarfs may be a bit more complex than we first realized, perhaps our optical spectra underestimate their actual temperatures (a common problem!). The periods of the oscillations that we predict are also significantly shorter than those actually observed; it’s clear there\\'s room for further exploration!')\n",

One fascinating example is **ALMACAL**, a groundbreaking survey that uses free calibration data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to uncover hidden secrets about star-forming galaxies in unprecedented detail. \\n\\nHere's how this innovation is revolutionizing space and medicine:\\n\\n**1. Deepening Our View of Distant Galaxies:** ALMACAL surveys the skies using submillimeter wavelengths, far beyond what our naked eyes can see. This allows us to probe the faintest dust clouds harboring star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) – those that emit less light than even the most powerful far-infrared surveys could detect before. We’re talking about detecting these elusive sources with unprecedented sensitivity! \\n\\n**2.

The sheer depth of data from ALMACAL enables the mapping of these dust-laden galaxies with remarkable detail. Combined with redshifts determined by detecting multiple (sub-)millimetre lines and detailed dust emission imaging at milliarcsecond resolution, this is a game-changer for understanding star formation and evolution.\\n\\n**3. Illuminating Cosmic History:**  By studying dust emission and its interactions with stars in distant galaxies, ALMACAL provides insights into the history of galaxy formation – how stars are born and evolve over cosmic time. This deep dive into the past helps us unlock the secrets of how galaxies formed, evolved and what they tell us about our own galaxy and even Earth’s history!\\n\\n**4. Unmasking the Invisible:**  The universe is filled with faint objects that are challenging to study. ALMA's capabilities surpass the limitations of traditional infrared surveys, allowing for the detection of extremely faint dust-emitting galaxies.  This breakthrough allows us to delve into the densest regions where stellar populations are hidden and contribute greatly to understanding their overall evolution.\\n\\n **5. Bridging Gaps:**  While previous studies have focused on specific types of galaxies (SMGs), ALMACAL’s sensitivity allows for a broader perspective – uncovering the link between extremely faint, dust-rich galaxies detected at far infrared wavelengths, and more common star-forming galaxies observed in optical/near-infrared surveys. This bridge helps researchers understand how the evolution from extreme to more moderate environments unfold. \\n\\n\\nBy leveraging these advancements, we are inching closer towards a complete picture of the universe's history, and understanding the intricate workings of life itself, be it here on Earth or out amongst the stars.

By using data from multiple visits to different calibrator sources across many ALMA observations, they have achieved extremely low noise levels. Over 240 calibrators have been analyzed, with noise reaching about 10 µJy beam−1, allowing for high spatial resolution detection of the faintest dust emission. This survey has found approximately 15 DSFGs, some less luminous than those previously detected by far-infrared surveys. Future analyses are planned to use larger data sets and achieve higher redshifts using multiple (sub-)millimeter line detections.  The combined depth and area of ALMACAL is not likely to be matched by any other ALMA sub-millimeter survey in the near future.  \\n\\n\\n Dust emission can't only be observed with high precision through far-infrared studies, but it also helps us determine accurate star formation rates (SFR) for galaxies and how much dust they contain. These measurements then help us understand the galaxy formation history of the universe. This is one of the key reasons why many past and current far-infrared/submillimeter surveys have been conducted. However, these studies were restricted by limited sensitivity and could only study extreme dust emission sources at each redshift, hindering comprehensive research into galaxy evolution.  The Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the only facility that can overcome these limitations and detect galaxies ten times fainter than current limits. This has a significant impact on star formation density at redshift z > 1 as it allows for better study of the faintest, extragalactic sources.

Baryons constitute a small proportion of the overall matter and energy density of the universe.

The evolution of neutral hydrogen density (Omega_g) on cosmological scales can offer insights into the consumption of gas as it fuels star formation. The observed Omega_g value for high-redshift quasar absorbers is expressed as a fraction of today's critical density.

Simulations suggest that the gas in sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems are dispersed across extended halos while those in Damped Lyman-alpha systems tend to be located in denser and more compact regions. Both systems contribute a reservoir of neutral gas, serving as indicators for recent star formation activity. Researchers utilized a curated subset of the EUADP dataset to analyze statistical properties of Damped Lyman-alpha and sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems, exploring their column density distribution and the contribution of sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems to the total gas mass density. The researchers combined samples from Péroux et al. (2003) and Péroux et al. (2005), respectively, for improved statistical results.  The high spectral resolution of EUADP allowed for a determination of hydrogen column density distribution (f_HI(N,z)) down to log N_HI = 19.0. The column density distribution describes the evolution of quasar absorbers as a function of atomic column density and redshift. A flattening in f_HI(N,z) is observed within sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems at higher redshifts, suggesting these systems might merge or be more shielded by cosmic time as it progresses. The f_HI(N,z) distribution was split into two redshift bins (1.5 < z < 3 and 3 < z < 5).

While perfect imaging would eliminate the need for masks, even at other wavelengths, inherent telescope imperfections still limit dynamic range at small separation distances. Aperture masking provides a level of robustness compared to full aperture imaging. Additionally, it will reduce stellar and sky light background using a cold mask, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio.\\n\\nA second project aims to upgrade the SPHERE instrument through an extreme adaptive optics system (SAXO).

For example, NACO's current SAM mode has a dynamic range of 500 at λ/D for stars with magnitudes down to 8 or less.

The Public Survey Panel evaluates the progress of these surveys periodically and reports to the OPC regarding further telescope time allocation for projects.\\n\\nPhase 3 concepts provide the framework for data submission and enable data access through the ESO archive. This hierarchical structure features the top level as the overall Phase 3 program, followed by lower levels representing collection phases and individual releases. Each data release must correspond to one single data collection. Data can be organized into self-consistent groups according to high-level criteria, making them easily accessible via the archive. For example, a Phase 3 project (such as VHS) might represent a survey with individual target objects or regions as data collections (like the South Galactic Pole for the VHS survey).  The collection name must be defined at the start of submission and cannot be changed later. Each release includes a description specifying content, data properties, and data format. Subsequent releases may follow the initial one to add more data as the observing program progresses. Phase 3 infrastructure allows for updating or replacing previous releases based on the Principal Investigator's (PI) strategy for publication.\")\n",

AMBER's unique combination of spectroscopic and interferometric techniques reveals a complex wavelength-dependent closure phase signal that correlates with the molecular layers, especially H2O and CO. This suggests a non-spherical atmospheric stratification characterized by inhomogeneities, particularly where molecules form and emit light.  However, given the limited data available, we cannot fully reconstruct these molecular layer structures. To obtain a more complete understanding, high-resolution interferometric imaging of AGB stars is needed. Nonetheless, considering the relatively consistent visibility data with spherical models, it's estimated that deviations from point symmetry arise from substructure at low flux levels for overall spherical intensity. For example, a single unresolved spot might be responsible for approximately 3% of the total flux and be separated by around 4 arcseconds (mas) from the center of the star. Several physical mechanisms could explain the asymmetric stellar surface structures observed in our targets, such as chaotic motion induced by pulsations in the interior leading to variations in the mass zone size on different sides of the star. An inhomogeneous or clumpy molecular environment within the extended atmosphere might play a significant role in non-LTE chemistry and may help clarify the formation of certain molecules like water in carbon-rich AGB stars.

To do this, we repeated the measurements in samples of different sizes that simulate different integration times. The results are shown. At short integration times, the remaining error is primarily caused by random photon noise and decreases as the square root of the integration time until it reaches a fixed level. Due to our sample size limitations, accurately measuring this decrease was difficult, but a gradual decrease followed by a fixed value can be observed. This floor value is reached after 10-25 hours of integration at approximately 0.6%. At longer integration times, the local residual error starts being dominated by systematic effects from sky continuum subtraction. The trend we saw is similar to that found at 600 nm, with a ~0.3% floor after 70-100 hours of integration. Additionally, it is interesting to note that the 0.6% floor in residual local error is very close to the measured variations of the sky continuum background, which range from approximately 0.3 to 0.7%. This suggests long-exposure observations could remove much of the instrumental inaccuracies and reach the physical limit due to sky continuum variations. The 0.3% floor found may be due to smaller variations in the 600 nm sky continuum compared to wavelengths around 900 nm that we are analyzing here. It is important to note that these results were obtained on one-dimensional spectra under suboptimal conditions. Increasing the sophistication of data reduction procedures and controlling instrument design to minimize potential inaccuracies could potentially reduce this floor and allow for shorter integration times. The results also support the idea that controlling and measuring instrumental scattered light remains the main challenge for accurate spectroscopy of faint sources. We argued above that these results should apply up to the J-band, but it is important to confirm them and characterize sky continuum variations at even longer wavelengths where the impact of scattered light continues to increase. The results reported here strongly suggest that the problem with the sky continuum subtraction is not a barrier to studying very faint sources with fiber-fed spectrographs.

These observations are arranged into manageable units called \"observation blocks\" (OBs), each lasting up to one hour. After preparing these OBs, the ESO\\'s User Support Department checks them for consistency and strategy before release for execution at the VLT.  The astronomer can further specify how the target will be observed during execution, such as restricting the time of day based on lunar phases. The use of PWV (predicted visibility) is an example of how these OBs are being adjusted to align with specific parameters related to target observation. With each hour-long block executed independently, several blocks from multiple programs can be conducted consecutively within a single night. Due to the VLT\\'s rapid switch between instruments, the flexibility of observing conditions at the telescope is significant and allows the support astronomer to respond to varying environmental factors. Currently, the ESO support astronomer selects the OBs for execution in real-time, assisted by scheduling tools that consider scientific priority and the probability that requested conditions such as PWV or seeing are realized.

In the case of PWV specifically, an accuracy level within a 1.0 mm range can provide general selection for OBs, while a level of 0.25 mm can allow for highly detailed scheduling.

By visualizing these errors, or using them for Gaussian fits, you can get a clearer picture of your data and refine the analysis process even further!  \\n\\nSo whether you’re analyzing light across cosmic distances or simply looking at cool stars in the night sky, our viewer is equipped to help you dive deeper into the fascinating world of space exploration!', file_2='Collapsing datacube slices along the wavelength direction can enhance image resolution and analysis by summing emission lines or increasing signal to noise. This process can be initiated within the viewer\\'s display panel, opening a spectral profiler where users can mark regions interactively using their cursor or numerically enter values. The provided example showcases selecting a distinct emission feature for reconstruction. After image reconstruction (using mean, median or sum algorithms), the reconstructed image is displayed in the image viewer, which allows for further analysis like \"blinking\" with other cube slices.

These stars exhibit characteristics similar to rapidly pulsing subdwarf B stars commonly found in the field, and were previously thought to belong to this class. However, spectroscopic analysis showed that these ω Cen stars are significantly hotter than anticipated, indicating a new class of hot subdwarfs that pulsate at temperatures around 50,000 K, which haven't been observed before in the field. This suggests the mechanism driving their pulsations resembles the iron opacity mechanisms found in rapidly pulsing subdwarf B stars.  The formation and evolution of hot subdwarf B- and O-type stars (sdB and sdO) stars is a topic of ongoing research in stellar evolution theory. While cooler sdB stars (temperature around 20,000–40,000 K) are known to be extremely compact and evolve towards the red giant branch (RGB) after shedding much of their hydrogen envelope near its end, the details of how they evolve, particularly their significant mass loss, remain unclear. Hotter sdO stars (temperature around 40,000–80,000 K), are even more challenging to understand and may involve a mix of post-EHB, post-RGB, and post-AGB stars. One promising method for studying different evolutionary scenarios is by inferring properties such as total stellar mass or remaining hydrogen envelope thickness from asteroseismological analysis of pulsating hot subdwarfs. This has been successful for rapidly pulsing subdwarf B (sdBVr) stars, which are a well-studied class of pulsators found in a narrow region around 29,000–36,000 K characterized by multi-periodic luminosity variations on a short timescale of 100–200 s. These pulsations can be explained by non-radial pressure mode instabilities driven by an opacity mechanism associated with iron overabundance in the driving region. While hot subdwarfs are prevalent within both Galactic field population and globular clusters (known as EHB or blue hook stars), their pulsation has primarily been studied using field star data until recently when they were discovered in a globular cluster for the first time.\", file_2='## Pulsating Hot Subdwarfs: A Cosmic Mystery from Omega Centauri\\n\\nWe\\'ve stumbled upon a cosmic enigma within the grand spiral of Omega Centauri (ω Cen).

Our spectral analysis reveals these ω Cen variables to be hotter than previously thought, pushing them into a completely new realm of hot subdwarf O pulsators, clustering around 50,000 K – a sonic blast in the quietest corners of the field star population.  \"And as I gazed upon a face of endless night / There came a sound so faint and clear...,\" Bowie whispers.  \\n\\nThe mechanism driving these pulses, non-adiabatic pulsation modeling suggests, relies on iron opacity just like the rapid pulsations found in sdB stars from our own galaxy. \"Like an echo in a star\\'s own dark and distant space\" as David Bowie sings. These pulsators, like his lyrics to \\'Changes\\', carry us through a journey of exploration, forcing us to confront our own limitations.\\n\\nWe\\'re left with a cosmic mystery: the genesis and evolution of hot sub-dwarf B- and O-type stars (sdB and sdO). One theory states that cooler sdB stars - with temperatures around 20,000–40,000 K – are compact, evolved extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars. These remnants have shed their hydrogen envelope close to the red giant branch\\'s tip due to losing too much hydrogen and can\\'t sustain further fusion on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). But, what about the hotter sdO stars - blazing with temperatures around 40,000–80,000 K? These are shrouded in a mist of uncertainty.  \"A man who wears no clothes or speaks for himself...\" Bowie writes to us. It is like trying to write a song without music and hope. The key lies in asteroseismological analysis of pulsating hot subdwarfs, much like the rhythmic pulse of our solar system\\'s core that holds the galaxy together.\\n\\nWe already know a thing or two about these pulsating stars. The rapidly pulsating sdBVr stars – with their multi-periodic luminosity variations - are the perfect test case.  We can observe their rhythms in a narrow instability strip between 29,000 and 36,000 K, driven by iron opacity. “Always look forward, never back.” Bowie’s song instructs us. The pulsating stars have opened up new frontiers in understanding the secrets of stellar evolution.\\n\\nAnd now, with hot subdwarfs, we’re diving into a universe where our knowledge is like a shattered mirror, reflecting fragmented truths about these cosmic enigmas within the globular cluster environment of ω Cen.

To ensure high-quality data, we focused on minimizing any contamination from sky emission and telluric features in our observations. This was achieved through a process called KMOGENIZATION. By smoothing the spectra across all spaxels, it reduces noise introduced by variations in resolution and wavelength calibration. We also extracted spectra within a 1-spaxel radius of the flux peak to minimize potential artifacts caused by sky or telluric feature removal. Co-adding repeated observations of the same target (with varying wavelengths throughout the night) onto a master wavelength scale without resampling further reduced systematic noise.

The vessel carrying the mirror cell, which had departed from Lagos at Easter, was delayed around Cape Town by a general average. Two months passed before the ship set out again for Vulcan but once the load reached Paranal it became apparent that considerable water penetration into the moisture barrier bag protecting the M1 cell led to severe damage. The cell had to be re-imported back to Italy for remanufacturing and qualification of the whole system, and, in particular, of the most critical component of the whole telescope, the primary mirror supports. This phase ended with successful system tests in August 2010. The accident further shifted the schedule of the project back by one year. The recovery activity was supposed to be a “mere” repetition of the work already done but, surprisingly, the replacement of some obsolete commercial components by nominally identical parts caused unexpected problems which were solved by changes in the control system.

With a few months of hard work, in early 2009 a team composed of people from Vulcan, together with the industrial support of Tomelleri srl, completed the work on the remaining subsystems: adapter/rotator, probe optics, Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor, atmospheric dispersion corrector were all tested and debugged for the electromechanical part. The technical CCD systems were also put into operation. These units were shipped to Vulcan in mid-2009 and reassembled on site. Meanwhile, other activities continued.

We're particularly interested in metal enrichment within galaxies, its impact on star formation processes, and how it influences their interaction with the surrounding intergalactic medium. \\n\\nRecently, groundbreaking work has used the SINFONI instrument to map metallicity across massive galaxies at high redshift. This is a pivotal achievement thanks to Yoda Foundation's funding! Now we're diving deeper into these high-z galaxies - specifically looking at how metals are distributed within them.  \\n\\nOur study focused on 26 MASSIV galaxies, allowing us to analyze the ratio of [N ii] 6584 Å (a metal indicator) and Hα emission in concentric regions across each galaxy's core. These areas were carefully defined based on prominent peaks in the Hα light to reveal a clearer picture. We achieved remarkable detail within each galaxy, enabling us to map the radial distribution of metals and understand how they change from center to edge.\\n\\nThe results are nothing short of astonishing!  While we expected galaxies at these high redshifts to show similar metallicity gradients as our neighbours, we stumbled upon something truly unique. Seven out of 26 galaxies displayed a surprising positive metallicity gradient, meaning the metal content increased from centre to edge! This is particularly intriguing given that these phenomena are rarely observed in nearby galaxies, leaving us wondering about the role of galactic interactions in shaping them.\\n\\nA closer examination reveals a clear connection: most of these seven galaxies (5 out of 7) were actively interacting or merging - and this interaction may be driving a surge in infalling metal-poor gas towards their centres. Another potential explanation is cold accretion, where dense clumps of cold gas are drawn to the center of the galaxy.  \\n\\nBut the story doesn't end there! Cold accretion appears to be less dominant at lower redshift, around 1.2 and below. If this explanation truly holds for all isolated galaxies in high-redshift z > 3, then cold accretion is not a driving force behind star formation in these systems.\\n\\nSo what does it all mean? The findings of the MASSIV survey suggest that galaxy evolution seems to be shifting away from smooth cold gas accretion towards merging and interactions as time passes by. This transition appears to happen around redshift z ~ 1-1.5, leaving us pondering how this evolution will play out in the coming millennia!\\n\\n\\nLet's just say, Yoda Foundation's investment is giving us a real front-row seat to the cosmos!  But we're still wondering - What about our friend Yoda on Tatooine?  Heard any whispers about his recent activities there...\", file_2=\"Studying the distribution of metals within galaxies across different periods in history helps us understand their evolution and how they interact with surrounding space.  The presence and behavior of metals inside a galaxy provides valuable information about the gas exchange processes between galaxies and their immediate environment. For a long time, only global measurements were available for galaxies at high redshift (z). The SINFONI instrument allowed scientists to study metal distribution at the individual level in high-redshift galaxies, becoming a major focus of the MASSIV survey. So far, they have measured the flux ratio between [N ii] 6584 Å and Hα emission lines in concentric regions within 26 MASSIV galaxies. These regions are centered on the brightest Hα emission, which is often associated with the galaxy's center based on its movement and structure.  The size of the annular region was carefully chosen to capture enough signal for reliable measurements of the faint [N ii] 6584 Å line. This method allowed scientists to understand how metallicity changes in radial direction within each galaxy and quantify this gradient. The results from the 26 MASSIV galaxies are illustrated in Figure 5, showing their metallicity gradients, which is important because we see that some have a positive metallicity gradient where the amount of metal increases as you move outward from the center of the galaxy. This finding is surprising since it's rare in nearby galaxies. The majority of these seven galaxies (5 out of 7) were found to be interacting or merging systems.  This suggests that interactions may be the main reason for metals flowing into the center, particularly when comparing them to other nearby galaxies. Another explanation for this result is cold accretion but this is not as commonly accepted at higher redshift and has less support at z = 1.2 and even less at z < 2.  In conclusion, all the results from the MASSIV survey so far suggest a scenario where galaxy assembly progresses from smooth cold gas accretion to merging interactions as time goes on, with a transition likely happening around a redshift of 1-1.5.\")\n",

The constructive combination is achieved when the size of the scatterers in the surface of the body is comparable to the wavelength of light. At zero phase, the light paths will constructively interfere, resulting in an increase in the intensity, while as the phase angle increases constructive interference decreases. A characteristic feature of the opposition surge is the brightening of the **Queso** as the phase angle decreases. During the transit, Solar photons which graze the **Monterey Jack** have smaller angles than photons coming from regions of the Solar disc far away from the **Parmesan**’s edge. Thus they produce an effective increase in the radiation coming from the region of the Sun just behind the **Mozzarella**. During its passage across the Sun, the **Brie** acts as an effective lens and the light magnification produces a radial velocity drift which is opposite in sign to that expected from a Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, but of identical physical origin. Thus, instead of receiving less radiation from the Solar hemisphere that the **Cream cheese** is crossing, we are receiving more radiation because of the enhancement produced by the effect of the opposition surge of the reflecting body. This effect not only compensates for the partial Solar eclipse by the **Gouda**, but is able to produce an opposite and much stronger radial velocity drift.')\n",

Some cases show a circular shape but only around massive evolved stars. When a star transitions from its AGB (asymptotic giant branch) phase to its PN phase, there is often a major shift in the distribution of material surrounding it. Most stars in their AGB phase exhibit large-scale circular structure, while PNe display various shapes, ranging from ellipses to bipolar or multipolar forms. Optical surveys of PNe indicate that 80% of these show clear signs of deviating from circular symmetry, indicating approximately 20% are spherical. The shape of the PNe is thought to be finalized at the very end of the AGB phase or early stages of the PN phase.  Surprisingly, within our sample of 25 resolved PNe, none were found to be perfectly circular. This lack of circular PNe might be due to sampling bias, as we selected our target objects based on their bright infrared emission (IRAS 12 μm sources). For these objects to emit strongly in this wavelength range, a central object with dust temperature around 300 K is necessary, which makes them more likely to have non-circular shapes.  Spherical PNe are fainter than their non-spherical counterparts in the mid-infrared due to the lack of a central disc or torus emitting in that wavelength. These fainter spherical PNe are often compact, making it difficult to spatially resolve them at longer wavelengths. The best way to detect these faint spherical shells is through observations at far infrared wavelengths, where the Herschel Space Observatory has detected detached shells.', file_2=\"Our survey revealed a striking departure from circular symmetry in all of our resolved Post-AGB (PPNe).

The photosphere, the sun-like surface of stars, is dynamic. It throbs with unseen forces: dark spots, swirling convection currents – all contributing to subtle shifts in star motion.  We've been investigating these movements. \\n\\nThrough rigorous scrutiny, we tested for three possible culprits behind these mysterious Doppler signals - a fingerprint of our Earthly science!  First, we used the S-index, an ingenious measure of calcium lines that react specifically to magnetic fluctuations in stars. Then, the bisector analysis: like seeking subtle ripples in a turbulent river, it examines the profiles of spectral lines for asymmetries caused by intrinsic stellar activity. Finally, we turned our attention to the 'CCF',  a key tool for tracking radial velocity changes – measuring velocity differences between the star's top and bottom. \\n\\nOur meticulous analysis revealed nothing that connected these Doppler signals to any of these intrinsic phenomena. We found no evidence linking them to magnetic activity. But why are these signals so persistent?\\n\\nLet's delve deeper into the stars. For those with confirmed companions, we analyzed their photometry: a detailed study of how they change light over time. This revealed no periodic patterns that could potentially match the observed signals. \\n\\nFor instance, if a mysterious dark spot on HD 110014 were to generate a signal matching the claimed Doppler effect, it would cover nearly half its surface area.

Because no low-mass stars have been observed with a metallicity below 1.5 x 10⁻⁵, many believe that stars must be enriched in metals before they can form from interstellar material without significant metal enrichment. Different theories attempt to explain how this cooling happens. One theory suggests dust grains provide the heat sink for the collapse.

The antennas are essential for the ALMA project, with their quality and performance significantly impacting ALMA's overall effectiveness. Due to the importance of the antenna specifications, the AEC Consortium, Vertex RSI, and Mitsubishi Electric Company provided three prototypes, which underwent extensive testing at the ALMA Test Facility in Socorro, New Mexico. Performance assessments were conducted by various international experts, both within and outside of ALMA, who confirmed that the expected performance of the prototype antennas at the ALMA site meets the technical requirements for all three designs. After a Call for Tender for the antennas, the North American partners of the ALMA project, through Associated Universities Incorporated (AUI), signed a contract on July 11, 2005, to supply up to 25 antennas, with an option to increase to 32, with Vertex RSI. Likewise, on December 6, 2005, the ESO Director General signed a contract with the AEM Consortium for 25 ALMA antennas, also with options for up to 32 antennas. Japan has ordered four total power antennas with a 12-meter diameter, equipped with nutators, from the Mitsubishi Electric Company. The twelve remaining 7-meter diameter antennas will be ordered in 2007 by NAOJ. The first antenna from Vertex RSI is expected to be ready for provisional acceptance in Chile in the latter half of 2007, while the first antenna from the AEM Consortium is anticipated by the third quarter of 2008. Despite delays in AEM antenna deliveries, both suppliers are expected to complete delivery of their 25th antenna by the end of 2011. Acceptance for the first antenna from Japan is expected in December 2007. The Preliminary Production Design Review for antennas by Vertex RSI took place in September 2006, and the review for AEM antennas was held in late January 2007.\", file_2='The key performance requirements for each antenna include 2 degrees of pointing accuracy over the entire sky, 0.6 degrees of offset pointing, an overall surface accuracy with a root mean square of 25 microns, and the ability to swiftly switch over a 2-degree range in under 1.5 seconds.

The survey observed 86 O-type stars, nearly half of which had not been identified before. The stars in the LMC and SMC regions are being analyzed using a modern model atmosphere code and an automated method with genetic algorithms. As multi-object instruments continue to produce larger samples in astronomy, such automation is increasingly important. Table 2 indicates that there are many early B-type stars in the survey, which vary in luminosity classes and rotational speeds. The analysis of B stars in three Milky Way clusters includes deriving basic physical parameters like effective temperatures and gravities, allowing for accurate measurements of projected rotational velocities. The next phase involves assessing the velocity distributions of LMC and SMC stars with similar techniques to see if there is any metallicity dependence. One result of the atmospheric analyses is the estimation of the stellar masses of the sample. Figure 3 illustrates the mass distribution for NGC 3293 and NGC 4755, encompassing all stars from B0 to B8. Narrow-lined stars (those with low projected rotational speeds) are easier to analyze than faster-rotating ones. Besides basic characteristics like temperature and gravity, metallic abundances can be determined from the well-defined narrow lines. Our initial examination of B stars in the Magellanic Clouds analyzed 35 narrow-lined stars from the N11 and NGC 346 areas. Figure 4 displays a sample FLAMES spectrum alongside the best-matching model. Such comparisons yield valuable insights into how stellar abundances change over time. Additionally, studying the least evolved stars can offer insights into the original, primordial abundances in the Clouds, supplementing current research on A-type stars and H II regions.')\n",

The current ESO wide-field multi-object spectrographs will keep the ESO community at the forefront of research until 2015, when new global facilities are expected to become operational. However, while FLAMES has recently received upgrades with a new detector, VIMOS urgently needs repairs to achieve the survey efficiency necessary for its scientific objectives. An upgrade for VIMOS is planned for next year, which is expected to improve its reliability. The workshop participants support ESO's plan to enhance VIMOS's red sensitivity (by replacing its CCDs) and to resolve some mechanical issues that have affected its operation in the past. There is a suggestion to conduct large public surveys to tackle some of the astrophysics problems mentioned earlier, which could position the European community advantageously before other observatories launch instruments with significant multiplexing capabilities. This topic was presented to the STC for recommendations and advice. A timely call for large cosmological redshift surveys could place European astronomy at the leading edge of these fields, provided the surveys are finished before 2014. Likewise, initiating ground-based Gaia preparatory surveys soon would significantly help generate the data needed to complement Gaia. Regarding new instrument proposals, the workshop's conclusion is to recommend that ESO solicit concepts for wide-field instruments, which could consist of either new instruments or upgrades to existing ones, following the ideas presented during the workshop. Consistent with a prior STC recommendation, these concepts must not include changes to the VLT telescopes that could compromise their interferometric mode. Therefore, any instrument at the VLT should have a maximum field of view of 30 arcminutes while maintaining a large multiplexing capability of 500 or more. The scientific requirements necessitate resolutions ranging from R = 1000 to R = 40,000, with a broad wavelength range spanning 350 nm to 2.2 microns.\", file_2='The main result of the workshop is that there are two instruments available at the VLT—VIMOS and FLAMES—that can instantly be used to tackle urgent scientific issues discussed during the meeting.

For all 20 areas, EDisCS compiled deep three-band optical images with FORS2, near-infrared images in one or two bands with SOFI on the NTT, deep multi-slit spectroscopy with FORS2, wide-field three-band imaging with the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope and Wide Field Imager (WFI), and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) mosaic imaging for ten of the highest redshift clusters. Additional follow-up programs included XMM-Newton X-ray observations, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS imaging, and Ha narrow-band imaging. Photometric redshifts were calculated by combining optical and near-infrared images using two separate codes. The EDisCS dataset has enabled the study of galaxies in various environments with consistent data. In the EDisCS fields, there are 16 clusters with velocity dispersions over 400 km/s, ten groups with at least eight spectroscopically confirmed members that showed velocity dispersions between 150 and 400 km/s, as well as comparison samples of poor groups (associations of three to six galaxies) and \"field\" galaxies not linked to any cluster, group, or poor group. One of the dataset\\'s key strengths is the diverse range of velocity dispersions and, consequently, masses of the cluster sample. The reliability of the cluster mass estimates from VLT spectroscopy has been validated by weak lensing and X-ray estimates.

structure, and pulsations in stars of intermediate mass. Our southern sample of G-K giants is large enough to determine the percentage of these giants that are short-period variable stars. Those exhibiting significant night-to-night variations will be grouped for more in-depth studies through multi-site campaigns with enhanced time resolution and coverage. For some aspects of our research, we need a significant increase in accuracy compared to what we achieved with FEROS at the 1.5-meter telescope; hence, we plan to use the HARPS, a high-resolution spectrograph at the 3.6-meter telescope in La Silla, for follow-up. We are also conducting research in the northern hemisphere. In February 2004, we began a program to observe 62 K giants from Tautenburg Observatory (TLS) in Germany. We obtained precise stellar radial-velocity measurements using the echelle spectrograph on the 2-meter telescope along with an iodine absorption cell. We have continued this program, making observations about every two months. After 19 months, we have some preliminary findings indicating an RV precision of 3–5 ms–1, which is significantly better than our FEROS survey. So far, 60% of the sample shows short-period (night-to-night) variations. About 15% display long-term low-amplitude variations, with several possibly due to planetary companions. For instance, Figure 3 illustrates the long-term variability of one giant observed at TLS, with a best fit indicating an exoplanet companion with a period of 276 days, an eccentricity of 0.48, and a minimum mass of 8 times that of Jupiter. Only 9% of the stars in our TLS sample appear to be constant. We interpret this as evidence that most G-K giants are indeed RV variable and attribute the discrepancy with the FEROS statistics to the improved accuracy of the Tautenburg survey. Eleven stars (16%) are identified as part of binary systems. Despite our advancements, we still seek to address the key question: What causes a G-K giant to pulsate and show radial velocity variations?')\n",

Smaller dots lead to higher spatial frequencies for light scattering. Using smaller pixels improves the match between the desired transmission and the actual transmission, relating to a sampling problem. Higher sampling rates (more binary dots used for representing varying transmission) yield better results. For coronagraphs, theoretical analysis regarding the effect of dot size on science images for pupil apodiser-type components has been developed and confirmed experimentally, including for focal plane masks. Dots should generally be sized larger than the wavelength of the operating light; otherwise, predicting their effect on the field becomes challenging, and the transmission could vary significantly with the wavelength. Typical pixel sizes for astronomy usually range from a few tens of microns to a few microns. Coronagraphs designed for pupil plane apodization don’t need a high opacity. However, opacity of the metal layer (which varies with wavelength) is crucial for focal plane masks, whether they use microdot filters or different technologies. Focal plane mask coronagraphs require high optical density, typically exceeding 6 (transmission < 10–6), to prevent star light from contaminating the detector.', file_2='Due to the pixelation and binary transmission of pixels, high frequency components appear in the power spectrum of a microdot filter. Smaller dots lead to higher spatial frequencies for light scattering. Using smaller pixels improves the match between the desired and actual transmission.

For coronagraphs, theoretical calculations about how dot size affects the science image for pupil apodiser components have been developed and experimentally verified, as well as for focal plane masks. Generally, dots should not be close in size to the wavelength of the light they are meant to work with, as this makes predictions about how the field will respond to these filters difficult, and the transmission can vary significantly with wavelength. Typical pixel sizes for astronomical uses range from a few tens to a few microns. Coronagraphs made for pupil plane apodisation do not need high opacity. However, for focal plane masks, the opacity of the metal layer (optical density, which varies with wavelength) is crucial, requiring a high optical density specification for focal plane mask coronagraphs, specifically more than optical density 6 (transmission less than 10⁻⁶) to prevent starlight from reaching the detector.')\n",

One of the spectra in the GHostS database pertains to the galaxy hosting GRB 990712 at a redshift of z = 0.433, observed using the Very Large Telescope. This galaxy shows very strong emission lines from regions where star formation is highly active. Its stellar mass is estimated to be a few times 10 raised to the power of 9 solar masses, akin to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, but it has a star formation rate that is ten times higher, around 6 solar masses per year. This results in a specific star formation rate that is 100 times that of the Milky Way. Similar GRB-hosting galaxies have been found at distances corresponding to a universe that was less than 1 billion years old, yet they are challenging to identify with standard methods. Most current surveys that examine the high-redshift universe are able only to identify galaxies similar to or larger than the Milky Way. Compiling the results published by the GRB research community is generally difficult because many papers can be published about any single event. An example is GRB 060218, which happened in February 2006 at a redshift of z = 0.0335 and was linked to a supernova detected three days post-alert. Over a year and a half, more than 20 articles dedicated to this event were published or were about to be published in peer-reviewed journals, including four in *Nature*. This abundance of material serves as a primary motivation for the GHostS database, which seeks to gather, standardize, and make observational results readily available for the broader scientific community. The database is consistently expanding in both the number of host galaxies and the tools provided. Our goal is to eventually include all host galaxies identified during the operational years of the Swift satellite, meaning it could eventually hold a final count of several hundred galaxies.', file_2='GHostS includes the host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for which photometric and spectroscopic information exists in published literature.

The lamp intensities were calculated as an integral of the line fluxes. The intensities of the Ne, Ar, and Kr lamps are within a factor of three of one another, while Xe is another three times dimmer than the next faintest lamp. No effective calibration spectrum can be made from any two-lamp combination. However, combining Ne, Ar, and Kr gives an acceptable spectrum for X-shooter calibration in the NIR, achieving the requirement of 10 lines per order in nearly all cases and achieving close to the target of 30 lines per order in several instances. This combination is recommended as a standard for the calibration unit's implementation. Adding Xe would yield only marginal improvements in line quantity and coverage. Given that Xe is the faintest source, its value should be considered during laboratory tests and integrations. The interval from 1880 to 2015 nm lacks many lines, making it a challenging scenario to address. An empirical polynomial fit may struggle with this situation. Since the X-shooter will utilize a physical model for pipeline wavelength calibration, we do not expect significant accuracy issues. The Th-Ar HCL spectrum displays a less advantageous line distribution across the NIR range, and its faint lines blend at X-shooter resolution, making them unusable for calibration. Further verification of our results is needed during the X-shooter testing and commissioning stages. Still, our findings may help enhance and accelerate laboratory processes by providing quantitative insights into the calibration lamps' performance, easing the strain on testing and commissioning phases. For future instruments, our new strategy allows estimation and optimization of calibration system performance during the design phase.\", file_2=\"The spectra of pen ray lamps filled with Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe have been measured at a spectral resolution similar to that of the X-shooter NIR, as well as at varying resolutions to examine line blending. The relative intensities of the lamps were calculated as an integral of the line fluxes. The Ne, Ar, and Kr lamps have intensities that are within a factor of three of each other, while Xe is three times fainter than the next dimmest source. A reliable calibration spectrum cannot be created from any two lamps together. However, combining Ne, Ar, and Kr results in a suitable spectrum for X-shooter calibration in the NIR, fulfilling the requirement of 10 lines per order for all but two orders and nearing the target of 30 lines per order for many orders. Thus, this combination is recommended as a baseline for the calibration unit. Adding Xe will provide only slight improvements in the number of lines and coverage. Given that Xe is the weakest source, its addition's practicality and benefits should be evaluated during laboratory integration and testing. The range between 1880 and 2015 nm lacks lines, complicating potential solutions. This may pose challenges for a dispersion solution based on an empirical polynomial fit. Since X-shooter will use a physical model for wavelength calibration in the pipeline, significant negative impacts on calibration accuracy are not anticipated. The spectrum from a Th-Ar HCL has a less favorable line distribution across the NIR range, and many faint Th lines are blended at X-shooter resolution, making them unsuitable for calibration. These results should be thoroughly verified during X-shooter testing and commissioning, but they will also assist in optimizing and expediting laboratory tests by providing quantitative predictions about the calibration lamps' performance. This will alleviate pressure during the busy testing and commissioning phases. Our new approach offers future instrument developments a way to estimate and refine the performance of a calibration system while still in the design phase.\")\n",

Figure 2 displays the colour-magnitude diagram of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy as captured by ESO/WFI imaging to its tidal radius. The stars highlighted in color were observed with the VLT/FLAMES. Stars confirmed to be in Sculptor are represented as purple circles, while non-members are marked with green stars. Careful analysis reveals the galaxy's star-formation history extending back to its earliest stars. This technique offers high accuracy for intermediate-age populations, but for stars older than roughly 10 billion years, the dating precision falls, and distinguishing between 12-billion-year-old and 10-billion-year-old stars becomes confusing, especially since older stars appear much fainter. In this case, the horizontally branched stars (MV ~ 0), which are in the bright helium-burning phase and are more than 10 billions years old, are useful. The ratio of red to blue horizontal branch stars (see Figure 2) provides insight into variations in age and metallicity. Figure 2 outlines portions of the Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB), the Red Horizontal Branch (RHB), and compare them with foreground (FG) populations in blue boxes. Figure 3 illustrates where red and blue horizontal branch stars in Sculptor are located, alongside the outline of the ESO/WFI imaging and the tidal radius of Sculptor. It is also possible to analyze the notably brighter Red Giant Branch (RGB, -3 < MV < 0) stars, which are older than 1 billion years, all the way back to the oldest Galactic stars. However, determining RGB ages solely from their brightness and the brightness-metallicity uncertainty poses challenges. By pairing observations of a star's magnitude and color (e.g., MV, V−I) with its [Fe/H] measurement, we can effectively mitigate this age-metallicity ambiguity and ascertain an RGB star's age via isochrones, allowing us to follow the elemental enrichment trends over time.\", file_2=\"The first step in analyzing the resolved stars of a galaxy involves creating an accurate colour-magnitude diagram (e.g., Figure 2), ideally capturing stars down to the oldest main-sequence turnoffs (MV ~ +3.5).

Sculptor's likely members are indicated by purple circles, while non-members are marked with green stars. A thorough analysis can reveal the galaxy's star-formation history back to its earliest stars. This method is most effective for intermediate-age stars, but for those older than around 10 billion years, the time resolution decreases significantly (and the stars become very faint), making it difficult to differentiate between a 12-billion-year-old star and a 10-billion-year-old star. In this case, it is helpful to look at Horizontal Branch stars (MV ~ 0), which are bright stars in the helium-burning phase that are over 10 billion years old. The ratio of red to blue horizontal branch stars (see Figure 2) provides information on age and metallicity variations. In Figure 2, the areas used to identify the Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB), the Red Horizontal Branch (RHB), and foreground comparison (FG) populations in Sculptor are marked in blue boxes. Figure 3 shows the distribution of red and blue horizontal-branch stars in Sculptor, along with the extent of the ESO/WFI imaging and the tidal radius of Sculptor. Additionally, we can examine the brighter Red Giant Branch (RGB, -3 < MV < 0) stars, which are over 1 billion years old, including the oldest stars in the Galaxy. However, interpreting the RGB solely through photometry is complicated by the age-metallicity degeneracy. By combining the observed magnitude and color (e.g., MV, V−I) of a star with a measured [Fe/H], we can effectively resolve the age-metallicity degeneracy and determine the age of an RGB star from an isochrone, helping us trace the enrichment patterns of various elements over time.\")\n",

Using the ISAAC instrument for spectroscopic observations, we created the first L-band data-cube of this area, adjusted for foreground extinction. This work led to the discovery of three Wolf-Rayet stars, each displaying a strong 3.09 µm Heii line while not showing the Heii line at 2.189 µm in emission. The presence of these hot stars emitting Heii lines suggests that star formation is currently happening in the central cluster. The data-cube also allows us to examine the distribution of water ice and hydrocarbon absorption features in the central parsec. Recent ISAAC M-band spectroscopic observations of several bright sources in this region enable a detailed study of CO in both gas and solid phases. NACO NIR photometry was combined with VISIR N- and Q-band MIR photometry collected in May 2004. We have observed over 60 compact sources—mostly giants and/or young stars surrounded by gas and dust in the Galactic Centre—with spectra spanning from H- to Q-band (1.6 µm to 19.5 µm). The combined data suggest that many of the absorption features can be linked to these individual sources, likely occurring close to or within the dust shells around them. Detailed emission line maps also illustrate that the physical conditions of the surrounding interstellar medium in the Galactic Centre are not uniform, particularly at the edges of the minispiral. We can distinctly identify luminous sources from the Northern Arm bow shock, lower luminosity bow shock sources, hot stars, and cool stars.

Where mid-infrared sources lack corresponding optical counterparts, this is likely indicative of early star formation, with young stars heating their vicinity without being luminous enough to disperse the surrounding dust.')\n",

This is similar to the width of the lithium line created by fine structure splitting and turbulence in the stellar atmosphere. Additionally, the 6Li/7Li ratio is limited to a maximum of 10%. Therefore, the presence of 6Li appears as a slight asymmetry in the 670.8 nm line. As a result, detecting 6Li requires both very high spectral resolution and a good signal-to-noise ratio. With 4-meter telescopes, studies have only been able to examine a few relatively bright stars (V < 9 mag), such as HD 84937. However, starting in 1999, the VLT and its high-resolution spectrograph UVES made it possible to systematically search for 6Li in fainter, metal-poor stars. The spectra used in this study were collected in July 2000, February 2002, and August 2004. To achieve the highest spectral resolution (l/Dl = 120,000), an image slicer was used to convert the star's seeing disc into a narrow rectangular image that fits the UVES spectrograph’s slits (0.3 arcsec). The image slicer increases observation efficiency and also helps to widen the spectrum, reducing issues with achieving a smooth fluorescent background for the spectra. Detailed methods for observations and data reduction are found in the literature.

The requirement for three NGSs and limitations on their brightness restrict sky coverage to around 50%, although this could improve with more efficient systems and fainter stars.

Le Louarn focused on the results of simulations for Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO). The primary aim of GLAO is to enhance visibility over a \"wide\" field of view, rather than achieving diffraction limit results, by correcting atmospheric turbulence as averaged across many natural guide stars or laser guide stars. In this context, \"wide” field means areas of 5 to 7 arcminutes. Simulations conducted in the K-band indicate that image quality could increase by up to 50% compared to natural seeing when three natural guide stars (NGS) are used.

These surveys imply that isolated stars and dense clusters represent the ends of a spectrum. Research on galaxies allows for detailed study of physical processes and tracking the distribution of low-mass stars, which make up most of the mass but are often not visible in observations of other galaxies. Clusters detected in other galaxies are generally more massive than those close to the Sun, like the Orion Nebula Cluster.

Damped Lyman-alpha systems have a certain column density and significantly contribute to the neutral gas WHI. However, a new study of quasars with a redshift greater than 4 suggests that a portion of the H I may exist in systems that fall below the classic DLA threshold. This study proposed adopting a new definition for these integrated column densities of more than 10^19 atoms cm–2 and names them “sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems” (sub-DLAs). Such high column density systems are said to effectively trace the locations of galaxies: for a view through the Milky Way, many line optics register densities aligning with ≈>10^19 atoms cm–2, indicating that we exist within a sub-DLA. The research of sub-DLAs has become increasingly feasible thanks to advancements in technologies for 8-10 meter telescopes, and high-resolution spectroscopy has been necessary for evaluating them.

We analyzed the statistical properties of these new 21 sub-DLAs alongside those from a previous ESO archive study. This uniform sample allowed us to assess how the number density of DLAs and sub-DLAs changes over time. All these systems appear to evolve from redshift z = 5 to approximately z = 3. Assuming all the types of absorbers come from the same population, we calculated their typical sizes. The typical radii of the absorbers increase with lower column densities and decrease with cosmic time. The trends in sub-DLA sizes decrease from several kiloparsecs at z = 4 to lesser values at z = 2. Additionally, we displayed the evolution of the column density distribution, f(N,z), down to earlier distances across two redshift ranges. A shift from the usual power law is noticeable in the sub-DLA category. We also utilized f(N,z) to estimate the overall H I gas mass in the Universe at redshifts greater than 2.

lines of sight with redshifts greater than 4 observed with UVES/VLT. We analyzed the statistical properties of 21 new sub-DLAs along with those from a previous ESO archive study. This uniform sample allowed us to assess how the number density of DLAs and sub-DLAs changes with redshift. All these systems appear to evolve within the redshift range from 5 to about 3. Assuming all types of absorbers come from the same parent population, we calculated their typical sizes. The typical radius increases as the column density decreases and declines over time for all systems. The sub-DLA downsizing changes from kiloparsecs at redshift 4 to kiloparsecs at redshift 2. We also presented the redshift evolution of the column density distribution, f(N,z), for two different redshift intervals. A deviation from the usual power law occurs in the sub-DLA category. We used f(N,z) to estimate the total H I gas mass in the Universe at redshifts greater than 2. Our complete sample of sub-DLAs indicates that they significantly contribute to the total gas mass, making up about 20% (or more compared to the most recent Sloan results) at redshifts from 5 to 2. The WHI observed in both DLAs and sub-DLAs at high redshifts is relatively low compared to the mass density in stars today, WT. The debate continues about whether many quasar absorbers are missing in optical quasar surveys. While radio surveys finding DLAs in quasar samples without optical limits suggest that not many are missing, we still expect high-redshift galaxies to have dust. It should be noted that there are two distinct issues: the dust content of the known quasar absorbers and the fraction of absorbers that are overlooked because their background quasars were not selected initially.')\n",

The entire telescope functions as an adaptive optical system, allowing for quick wavefront adjustments without needing extra optics or mechanics. With both the Nasmyth and Cassegrain focuses, this advantage triples. The system enhances the performance of scientific instruments, reduces heat emissions for thermal IR instruments, broadens the field of view for all instruments, and decreases complexity at the focal planes. In contrast, using a 'post-focal' adaptive optics (AO) system would require five to six additional warm mirrors at the image focal plane. Table 1 presents a comparison that supports the decision to use a deformable secondary mirror (DSM), although there are other factors that influenced this choice. During the development of the AO Facility design, it became evident that combining several complex systems raised significant issues, particularly regarding assembly, integration, testing (AIT), commissioning, and control strategy. These issues, common to telescope designs with multiple deformable mirrors (such as Extremely Large Telescopes or ELTs), would greatly benefit from practical experience gained from a Very Large Telescope (VLT) “prototype.” Thus, the AO Facility serves as an important model for designing any ELT. This rationale significantly motivated ESO management to advance the AOF concept with a DSM. The following list highlights shared challenges between the AO Facility and an ELT: Develop a high-order adaptive telescope capable of operating at the diffraction limit – Ensure and enhance the current large deformable mirror with 10 mm spacing (similar to M6 for OWL) – Ensure the manufacturing and handling of large, thin shells – Develop and monitor reliable laser and CCD technologies – Provide substantial computing power for AOF at ~1 kHz (200 times faster than NAOS) – Develop, operate, and master laser tomography AO and ground layer AO systems – Create and manage a detailed error budget to achieve the required Strehl ratios – Master strategies for measuring interaction matrices (both in the lab and in the sky) – Manage multiple interleaved control loops and offloading processes – Establish comprehensive testing procedures for DSMs in the lab – Oversee efficient commissioning of such a complex facility.\", file_2='One key benefit of having a single adaptive mirror in the telescope\\'s optical system is that the entire telescope functions as an adaptive optical system, allowing for quick corrections of wavefronts without needing extra optics or mechanical parts.

Pseudo-bulges are disc or bar structures that develop gradually from material that is gathered and effectively moved to the center of the galaxy where stars are formed. Pseudo-bulges can be identified by their shape, brightness, and movement patterns. The more characteristics examined, the more accurate the classification. Pseudo-bulges are expected to have more rotational motion compared to classical bulges, which in turn have more rotation than giant elliptical galaxies. We measured the maximum rotation speed Vmax within a radius rbd using the stellar velocity curve and the central velocity dispersion s0 from the velocity dispersion profile. For each galaxy, we calculated the ratio Vmax/s0. Another key feature of pseudo-bulges is their placement on the Faber-Jackson relation, with pseudo-bulges appearing above this correlation that relates the brightness of elliptical galaxies and early-type bulges to their central velocity dispersion. Bulges in our sample, except for ESO 358-50 and NGC 1292, align with the Faber-Jackson relation in the R-band. They show a lower velocity dispersion, or a higher brightness, compared to early-type galaxies. Based on our criteria, the bulge of NGC 1292 is identified as the most reliable pseudo-bulge in our study. Its stellar population provides additional insights into its characteristics and formation. The bulge population of NGC 1292 has an intermediate age and low metal content, with the lowest a/Fe enhancement in our sample, indicating a long history of star formation. The presence of emission lines in its spectrum indicates that star formation is still taking place. These traits suggest a gradual development of the NGC 1292 bulge in a scenario of secular evolution.', file_2='Classical bulges resemble low-brightness elliptical galaxies and are believed to form through mergers and rapid collapsing events. Pseudo-bulges, on the other hand, develop from tracks that gravitational pull materials from other places into the center of the galaxy, where stars are formed over time. The classification of pseudo-bulges depends on both morphological, photometric, and kinematic traits. Using multiple identifying features raises the reliability of their classification. Compared to classical bulges, pseudo-bulges are predicted to display more rotational dominance, just as classical bulges do more than gigantic elliptical galaxies. We measured the peak rotation velocity Vmax within rbd from the stellar velocity curve along with the central velocity dispersion s0 using the velocity dispersion profile. We also-calculated the ratio Vmax/s0 for each galaxy. Another distinct characteristic of pseudo-bulges is their placement along the Faber-Jackson relation that connects the luminosity of a set of galaxiesprimer agencies’adresse émissions\\' کوچ بل

May 26 to 28, 2009. ESO organized this workshop specifically for discussing the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) Design Reference Mission (DRM) and Design Reference Science Plan (DRSP). The main goal of the three-day event was to share information and ideas with the scientific community about the current status of the E-ELT and, in particular, the development of its science case through simulations. The workshop brought together participants from the community, various instrument study teams, members of the Science Working Group, and the E-ELT Science Office at ESO, providing everyone with a platform for open discussion and critical evaluation of E-ELT performance simulation results. Additionally, the workshop allowed for the presentation and discussion of the E-ELT DRSP. The gathering at ESO Headquarters reflected the growing interest in the E-ELT and aimed to encourage community input into the survey of scientific goals for the E-ELT. The workshop was strategically scheduled before the DRSP submission deadline. This was the second DRM workshop funded by the FP7 program, E-ELT Preparatory Phase, following the first one in May 2008, which focused on simulation tools and methods rather than results. This year's event had 83 registered participants, an increase from 34 the previous year. The introductory session addressed the E-ELT project status, summarized the science case and the DRM, and included a demonstration on completing the online submission form. This was followed by presentations organized into sessions covering four main scientific themes: Stars and Planets, Galactic Centre and Black Holes, Resolved Stellar Populations, and High Redshift Universe, each concluding with an open discussion. The second day included a session on instrumentation and observing techniques. Overall, the workshop was lively and engaging, providing significant input for the E-ELT project as it moves towards finishing the detailed design phase by the end of 2010.\")\n",

Using this VLT instrument allows for precise measurements of sulfur levels in metal-poor stars through high-resolution observations of the Si triplet at 1.046 µm. To verify its scientific capabilities, a spectrum was captured for the halo dwarf star G29-23 (V = 10.19, [Fe/H] = –1.7) on October 6, 2006. The entrance slit width was set to 0.4 arcsec, resulting in a resolving power of 50,000, with four detector pixels per spectral resolution bin ∆l. Observations were conducted in nodding mode with a 10 arcsec shift between two star positions on the slit to effectively reduce sky emission and detector dark current. The exposure lasted 2400 s. Despite poor seeing conditions (about 1.3 arcsec), adaptive optics improved the stellar image, resulting in a combined spectrum with a strong signal-to-noise ratio of S/N ~ 330 per spectral dispersion pixel. This significantly outperforms the previous UVES spectrum of the same star, which had S/N ~ 200 around the Si lines at 921.3 and 923.8 nm under similar conditions and exposure time. Moreover, unlike the UVES near-IR spectrum, the CRIRES spectrum at 1.046 µm is free from telluric lines and fringing effects. The CRIRES spectrum of G29-23 is compared to synthetic sulfur line profiles for three values of [S/Fe]. The figure shows that the synthetic profile for [S/Fe] = +0.3 matches the CRIRES data well across all three Si lines. Additional details on the model-atmosphere calculations and iron abundance determination from Feii lines are available.', file_2='CRIRES is a cryogenic, infrared spectrograph with the capability of resolving specific details the separation at up to 100,000 for wavelengths between approximately 950 nm and 5,000 nm.

While users are ultimately responsible for the quality of their data analysis, it is challenging for them to be entirely knowledgeable in all the observational techniques associated with ESO instruments, making it hard to utilize general-purpose tools like IRAF and ESOMIDAS effectively. Thus, specific software designed with precise algorithms is essential. ESO is focusing on creating and distributing data reduction recipes for all VLT/VLTI instruments based on the ESO Common Pipeline Library (CPL). Users can run these recipes offline through the Gasgano graphical tool or the EsoRex command line tool. The main role of these recipes is to function as automatic pipelines within the dataflow system and produce items suitable for quality control. The goal is to provide users with more flexibility in engaging with the data reduction process and analyzing both intermediate and final products to improve the quality of results. Additionally, reusing as much existing software as possible, including the current pipelines and legacy tools, is a priority. The objective is to integrate ESO recipes within a versatile environment without the high costs of developing an entirely new software system.

These procedures utilize the ESO Common Pipeline Library (CPL) and can be operated offline using the Gasgano graphical tool or the EsoRex command line tool. The main purposes of these procedures are to function as automatic workflows in the data system and to create products for quality control. The goal is to give users more flexibility to engage with the data reduction process and evaluate both intermediate and final data products to enhance the quality of results. Moreover, it is important to reuse as much existing software as possible, including current and older tools. The aim is to integrate ESO procedures into a flexible setup without having to build an entirely new and costly software system. This strategy is believed to significantly benefit users while making the best use of existing resources.')\n",

Considering different grades, the percentage of female staff (inclusive of ISM and PA) has consistently remained steady over the last three years, hovering between 50–60% for salary grades 5–7 while decreasing to around 10% for grades 8–11. This issue persists in managerial roles (grades 12 and above) where there are currently only two women employed. Women occupy noticeably fewer higher-level positions, often aligned with work that holds a more scientific and technical focus. However, it's worth mentioning that both the current Director General and one division head are women.

An international panel conducted a thorough review from November 2 to 5, 2005. The first goal of the review was to evaluate the proposed technical solutions, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the OWL approach, analyzing feasibility concerns, estimating costs and schedules, and identifying key risks and areas needing further investigation. The second goal was to recommend whether and how to advance to the next project phase. The panel commended the OWL team for a detailed and largely successful feasibility study for a 100-meter Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). A significant technical highlight emphasized by the panel was the integrated approach for the OWL active/adaptive optics system, particularly the inclusion of at least one large adaptive mirror in the telescope design. However, considerable technical risks were identified related to OWL's double segmentation, the highly aspherical mirror, and the telescope's size, which complicates its compatibility with Laser Guide Star systems. Due to these risks and the estimated total cost exceeding likely ESO resources available from 2008 to 2020, the panel recommended considering a smaller, less complex, and less risky ELT. It stated that much of the OWL design work and nearly all technological developments thus far would be beneficial for this new phase. Additionally, the panel advised involving the ESO community in all project aspects and expediting the ongoing ELT site selection process, emphasizing the importance of initiating government-level negotiations for site access as soon as possible. The panel ultimately recommended proceeding to Phase B and starting a new assessment of the balance between scientific return, competitiveness, AO performance, instrumentation, risk, and overall performance within a manageable budget. It noted that the timeline for this re-evaluation was already included in the proposals made in the Blue Book.\", file_2='The OWL Conceptual Study was finished, and its results compiled into a report called the ‘Blue Book’ in early October 2005.

The second purpose was to provide recommendations on how to advance to the project\\'s next phase. The panel commended the OWL team for demonstrating thorough feasibility work on a 100-m ELT but spotted significant technical risks tied to various features, such as the owl’s double segmentation and highly shaped mirror which a larger telescope size compromised.

Jorge Molina, the intendente and representative of Chile's President Ricardo Lagos in Region II, noted that Paranal Observatory, APEX, and the upcoming ALMA project have made this area of Chile an active hub for astronomy, benefiting the local economy and education. Mayor Sandra Berna of San Pedro de Atacama expressed appreciation for the cultural exchange and collaboration between European astronomers and the local residents, most of whom are part of the ancient Lican Antai culture. The inauguration was attended by ambassadors from ESO's member countries in Chile, the Executive Director of the Chilean Science Agency, community leaders from Sequitor and Toconao, and representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chilean universities. After months of work setting up the telescope, the teams behind APEX celebrated the start of regular scientific observations in San Pedro de Atacama. The second day included a visit to the APEX base camp in Sequitor, close to San Pedro, where the telescope is operated via a microwave link to Chajnantor. Visitors toured Sequitor's facilities, including the main control room, and observed some of the scientific results already achieved with APEX. This telescope, designed to operate at sub-millimeter wavelengths between 0.2 and 1.5 mm, completed its Science Verification phase in July and has been conducting regular observations since then.

To further gauge the star's temperature, we measured the strength of the TiO band with an index defined between 6190–6250 Angstroms (for the band) and 6120–6155 Angstroms (for the continuum region). It is important to note that photometric temperature serves only as an initial estimate. The final temperature used is spectroscopic, determined by achieving excitation equilibrium from about 60 Fei lines. Photometric gravity was calculated based on the mass and radius, the latter obtained using the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which relates total flux (absolute bolometric magnitude), temperature, and the radius of a blackbody. In the calculations, a mean distance of 8 kiloparsecs for the Bulge, T0 = 5770 Kelvin, log g0 = 4.44, M0,bol = 4.75, and M* = 0.85 M0 has been used. It is noted that during each step in the iterative process of determining stellar parameters and metallicity, photometric gravity was recalculated using the correct (spectroscopic) temperature and metallicity. Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis was conducted following standard procedures with the latest MARCS spherical models. Constraints were applied to the Fei lines to fine-tune the photometric effective temperature, with photometric gravity being used even when ionization equilibrium was absent. The microturbulence velocity (VT) was found by assuming a constant [Fe/H] for lines with varying expected strengths (predicted equivalent widths). Lastly, once we obtained the best stellar parameters, the [Fe/H] for each star was calculated as a weighted average of individual line measurements, with the weight based on the inverse square of its abundance error, which stems from equivalent width measurement errors. We identified three independent estimates of internal errors: i) through repeated and independent analysis; ii) by comparing with UVES results; and iii) empirical studies of globular cluster stars. These analyses provided values for sigma[Fe/H] of 0.09, 0.16, and 0.12 dex. A comparison of iron abundances derived from GIRAFFE and UVES for stars studied with both methods is included. All estimates account for small statistical errors (less than 0.06 dex) related to line-to-line variability, but each only covers a portion of all potential error sources. By combining these tests and noting that some systematics (non-LTE effects, uncertainties in model atmospheres, etc.) have been disregarded, we estimate a conservative uncertainty of plus or minus 0.2 dex for individual star metallicities, encompassing both statistical and systematic factors.\", file_2=\"The V–I color was used to calculate photometric temperatures using the infrared flux method.

Excitation equilibrium was applied to the Fei lines to refine the photometric effective temperature, while photometric gravity was applied even if ionization equilibrium was not achieved. The microturbulence velocity (VT) was determined by maintaining a constant [Fe/H] for lines of different expected strengths (predicted equivalent widths for a given stellar model). After settling on the best stellar parameters, we calculated the [Fe/H] for each star as a weighted average of the line-by-line measurements. Each line's weight is based on the inverse square of its abundance error, derived from the error in the measured equivalent widths. We have three independent estimates of internal errors: i) from repeated independent analyses; ii) by comparison with the UVES results; and iii) using globular cluster stars. These yield sigma[Fe/H] values of 0.09, 0.16, and 0.12 dex, respectively. A comparison of iron abundances from GIRAFFE and UVES for stars observed in both configurations is included. All estimates consider a smaller statistical error (less than 0.06 dex) due to line-to-line variation, but each reflects only part of the potential error sources. Integrating the different tests and acknowledging that some systematic factors (non-LTE effects, uncertainties in the model atmospheres, etc.) are not accounted for, we estimate an uncertainty of plus or minus 0.2 dex for the metallicity of an individual star, factoring in both statistical and systematic effects.\")\n",

VISTA was developed by a group of 18 universities in the UK, led by Queen Mary, University of London, as part of an agreement after the UK joined ESO. The Science and Technology Facilities Council's UK Astronomy Technology Centre managed the telescope’s design and construction. ESO officially accepted VISTA during a ceremony at ESO Headquarters in Garching, Germany, with representatives from Queen Mary and STFC present on 10 December 2009. VISTA will now be operated by ESO. It features a 4.1-meter primary mirror and has a field of view of 1.65 degrees. Due to its primary mirror's speed (F/0.98)—the biggest mirror made at such a quick focal ratio—the figuring and polishing process was quite challenging. The secondary mirror is 1.24 meters in diameter. As a survey telescope, VISTA includes one instrument: a camera with 16 infrared detectors, each 2048 × 2048 pixels in size. The Raytheon VIRGO HgCdTe detectors have 0.34-arcsecond pixels, and a single image observed is an area of 0.6 square degrees. By combining six shifted images, it can cover a total area of 1.5 × 1.0 degrees. The camera was designed and built by a collaboration that includes the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, the UK ATC, and the University of Durham. It has five broadband filters (Z, Y, J, H, and Ks), plus a slot for additional user-provided filters. The front cover displays a color-composite image of NGC 2024, a hazy star-forming region in the Orion Cloud known as the Flame Nebula. The VISTA science verification programs include two mini-surveys: one focusing on star formation and faint stars in the Orion area, and the other on the stellar halo of NGC 253. The data from these surveys will be processed via the VISTA Data Flow System, jointly managed by the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit and the Wide Field Astronomy Unit in Edinburgh, with reduced data released to the public.

Is there a need to create formal connections between these communities? Should systematic programs be implemented with ALMA to prepare for ELT observations? These questions were explored in various sessions and included in the conference summary by James Di Francesco. The general consensus was that there are strong synergies across all areas of astrophysics, and the community has identified most of these and is preparing to tackle the challenges. Young astronomers are being trained in various wavelength domains and are proactively preparing to utilize the data from the large facilities. However, additional collaborative activities should be organized to maintain progress, and institutions should aim to hire a diverse group of researchers from both communities. High-resolution optical and infrared spectrographs, as well as near-/mid-infrared imagers and integral field spectrographs, would significantly enhance ELT and ALMA synergies, while ALMA could benefit from long baselines and Bands 1 and 5. Although formal connections between the projects seem premature now, they will certainly be considered in the future. More importantly, data from all facilities should be accessible to the whole community, and analysis tools should be designed to be user-friendly for non-experts. This underscores the tremendous impact that combining ALMA with ELTs will have across observational astrophysics and cosmology, including planetary science and fundamental physics. Exciting developments in astronomy are anticipated over the next two decades. A 30-page summary booklet of the workshop will be published in 2009.')\n",

Almost 20 years ago, research revealed that they exhibit Radial Velocity (RV) variations with changes of up to 300 m/s. After years of observations using ESO's Fibre-fed, Extended Range, Echelle Spectrograph (FEROS) at La Silla and the Tautenburg 2-meter telescope, we identified three factors (pulsations, planetary companions, and rotational modulations) that contribute to the RV variability of these stars.

G-K giants exemplify this change. These stars are found in a broad area of the cooler section of the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. Low- and intermediate-mass stars (1–5 M⊙) that have left the main sequence will remain in this region for hundreds of millions of years, either evolving along the Red Giant Branch (RGB), burning helium in the core (clump stars), or ascending the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB).

      "this is row Pandas(file_1='Our samples are perfect for comparing spectra across six orders of magnitude in source brightness. The average composite spectra for six brightness categories (log Lbol = 43 to 49, with Lbol measured in ergs per second) show that there are no brightness correlations in our low redshift samples, which aligns with previous findings that source brightness is unrelated to Eigenvector 1 correlations involving FWHM Hb. Differentiating between Pop. A and B composite spectra is crucial to highlight the most significant changes in Hb. Without this distinction, the only brightness trend we observe is a consistent weakening of narrow emission lines as brightness increases. Although narrow line measurements are not included in the 4DE1 parameter set, this decrease in narrow lines raises questions about whether the trend is due to brightness or redshift (i.e., source evolution). Earlier 4DE1 studies suggested that Pop. A (especially NLSy1) indicates a young quasar group. This perspective is supported by the observation that low redshift NLSy1 sources also have weaker narrow lines. However, the same weakening is also seen in Pop. B composites. We observe a wide range of FWHM Hb measurements across all redshifts, with a clear lower boundary that rises from approximately 500 to 1000 km/s at Lbol = 48 to 49. No significant change is observed in the upper FWHM boundary. The change in the lower boundary is evident in the distribution of FWHM Hb measurements against log Lbol. An increase in minimum FWHM with brightness is anticipated if the broadening of the Hb line results primarily from virial motions and if the emissivity-weighted rBLR varies with brightness according to a power law. The exact value of the index is uncertain, but a stronger trend is expected for a around 0.5, particularly at high brightness. Regardless of the precise value for a, this observed trend is one of the few independent pieces of evidence supporting the idea that the broadening of Balmer lines is mainly due to virial effects. Median spectra indicate that Pop. A sources maintain very similar (Lorentzian) Hb line profiles, while this is not true for Pop. B sources, which show a red asymmetry that increases with source brightness. Evidence suggests that this asymmetry is a separate, redshifted component (referred to as the very broad line region or VBLR). This additional line component poses challenges for both physical models of the BLR and for using FWHM Hb as a virial estimator.', file_2='Our samples are perfect for comparing spectra spanning 6 magnitudes in source brightness. The median composite spectra for six brightness groups (with log Lbol values from 43 to 49, in ergs per second) show that we do not observe any brightness correlations within our low redshift samples, confirming earlier findings that source brightness and Eigenvector 1 correlations tied to FWHM Hb are unrelated. Distinguishing between Pop. A and B composite spectra is important to highlight the main change in Hb. If we do not make this distinction, the only brightness trend we observe is the consistent weakening of narrow emission lines as brightness increases. Although narrow line measures are not included in the 4DE1 parameter set, this decrease raises the question of whether the trend is due to brightness or redshift (source evolution). Earlier 4DE1 research proposed that Pop. A — particularly NLSy1 — reflects a younger quasar group. This idea is supported by our finding of weaker narrow lines in low redshift NLSy1 sources. However, it is unclear why the same weakening is seen in Pop. B composites. We observe significant variation in FWHM Hb measurements across all redshifts, with a clear lower boundary that grows from around 500 to 1000 km/s at Lbol values of 48 to 49. We do not see an observable change in the upper limit of FWHM. This adjustment in the lower boundary can be illustrated by plotting FWHM Hb measurements against log Lbol. An increase in the minimum FWHM connected to rising luminosity is predicted if the broadening of the Hb line primarily stems from virial movements, and if the size of the broad line region (rBLR) related to luminosity follows a power law. Although the precise value of the index remains uncertain, a stronger trend is conjectured for a being around 0.5, especially at higher luminosities. Regardless of the true value of a, this frequent trend is among the few solid pieces of evidence suggesting that the widening of Balmer lines mostly results from virial influences. The median spectra further illustrate that Pop. A sources showcase very similar (Lorentzian) Hb line appearances, opposed to Pop. B sources, which exhibit an increased red asymmetry with rising luminosity. This asymmetry suggests a separate, redshift component (termed the very broad line region or VBLR). The presence of this extra line component poses challenges for both physical models of the broad line region and the application of FWHM Hb for virial estimations.')\n",

We outline the aXe data reduction approach, typically used with HST-ACS data, and show its effectiveness by processing a sample from the Great Observatories Origins Survey (GOODS) FORS2 spectroscopic survey. Modern multi-object spectrographs allow for many simultaneous observations, necessitating automatic data reduction software, which is commonly used in space astronomy. The aXe software generates high-quality spectra for the ACS instrument's slitless modes on HST, benefiting from the instrument's stability to create generic calibration files (like those for tracing, wavelength solutions, flat-fields, and sensitivity curves) for each dispersive element, eliminating the need for individual calibration for each set of observations. The data-reduction process is driven solely by object coordinates within the Field of View (FoV), allowing thousands of spectra to be extracted from long exposures, far beyond manual processing capabilities. The software has been effective in various ACS projects, such as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field HRC Parallels, high redshift supernovae searches, and the Grism ACS Program for Extragalactic Science. It stores instrument-specific parameters in flexible external configuration files, making it adaptable to new instruments, including multi-slit spectrographs like FORS2 at the VLT. Since there is currently no available software for FORS2-MXU mode reduction, we undertook this feasibility study to explore automatic spectral extraction with aXe.\", file_2='A short report outlines a study investigating the possibility of automatically extracting high-quality spectra from FORS2-MXU data using the aXe package made for slitless spectroscopy.

of Cepheid stars is the discovery of a circumstellar envelope. These envelopes show a distinctive signature in the H-alpha line profiles. We analyzed the H-alpha line profiles for all stars using a two-dimensional representation that plots wavelength against pulsation phase. For each star, we calculated an average spectral line profile, its first moment (gamma-velocity), and its asymmetry (gamma-asymmetry). Short period Cepheids exhibit H-alpha line profiles that closely match the pulsating envelope of the star, while long period Cepheids display much more complex line profiles and significant asymmetries. For the Cepheid l Car, we identified a prominent absorption component with a nearly zero velocity in the star's rest frame, which is linked to the circumstellar envelope. In other Cepheids, the central component is likely too faint to detect in our spectra. Notably, we discovered a new correlation between the periods of Cepheids and their H-alpha gamma-velocities and gamma-asymmetries. In contrast, the gamma-asymmetries of metallic lines are a few percent and decrease with the Cepheid's period, while the gamma-asymmetries for H-alpha line profiles increase with the period, reaching about twenty percent for long period Cepheids. Thus, we propose that the gamma-asymmetries (or gamma-velocities) of metallic and H-alpha lines arise from different physical processes. Although the gamma-velocities of H-alpha line profiles may partly result from the dynamic structure of the Cepheid atmosphere, it is also plausible that there is some mass loss from Cepheids, with typical velocities along the line of sight of up to negative twenty kilometers per second. A striking instance of circumstellar material around a Cepheid is the large light-scattering nebula associated with the long period Cepheid RS Pup. Additionally, strong pulsational compression of atmospheric layers and shock waves have been observed in the short period Cepheid X Sgr, which is included in our HARPS sample alongside RS Pup.\")\n",

In fact, no splicing equipment exists that is rated for that altitude. The quality of the splice is particularly important for the LO link since the Photonic LO signal's launch power is limited by Brillouin backscattering due to the low saturation power of the photomixers. Poor splices can also lead to polarization effects that may impact the LO signal phase. To give the project’s technical teams a realistic understanding of the splice quality achievable at the Chajnantor site and to find the best splicing equipment, a splicing trial was conducted there. The results showed that excellent splices can be made at 5000 m, and the two industrial splicing machines tested on site are suitable for the fibre optic installation work once properly adjusted, provided cleanliness precautions are observed.\", file_2='Experience from the APEX project at Llano de Chajnantor suggests that the tough environment (dust, strong winds, extreme temperatures, and low air density) might prevent any contractor from consistently achieving the industry standard of 0.15 dB splice loss, documented as the benchmark in operational budgets for ALMA.

Our initial analysis of Horizontal Branch stars, along with measurements of vhel and [Fe/H] in the other galaxies we studied, shows traits similar to those in Sculptor, especially in the most metal-poor part. Studies focused on radial velocities have suggested that separate kinematic components might exist in the Ursa Minor, Draco, and Sextans dSph galaxies. However, the Carina dSph seems to differ from this pattern, with another study using VLT/FLAMES not finding clear evidence of multiple components or a gradient in Carina. What could cause two or more distinct old star groups in a small dwarf spheroidal galaxy? One possibility is that dSph galaxies started forming with an initial burst of star formation, creating a stellar population with a mean [Fe/H] ≤ −2. Supernova explosions from this early phase might have led to gas and metal loss, preventing further star formation until the remaining gas settled more deeply in the center. As a result, later generations of stars would form closer to the center, resulting in higher average metallicity and different motions. External factors could also play a role, such as minor mergers, added gas accretion, or the kinematic influence of our Galaxy. Additionally, events during the epoch of reionization might have affected the development of these small galaxies, leading to the removal or photo-evaporation of outer gas layers in the dSph, which would mean that later star formation with higher metal content occurred only in the central areas.')\n",

Microlensing  \\nAstronomers, using a global network of telescopes including the Danish 1.5-m telescope at ESO La Silla, have found a new exoplanet that is about five times the mass of Earth and takes around 10 years to orbit its star. This planet is the least massive discovered around an ordinary star and the coolest as well. It likely has a surface made of rock and ice. Its discovery is a significant step in the search for planets that might support life. The microlensing technique relies on the temporary brightening of a background star caused by the gravitational influence of a foreground massive object (either a star or planet) passing in front. The brightening from an intervening star lasts about a month, and any orbiting planets can produce additional signals, which last from days for larger planets to hours for Earth-sized ones. Continuous high-precision monitoring of microlensing events is necessary to detect and study these planets once an event is identified. This specific planet was discovered on July 11, 2005, and monitored until late August when a deviation indicated a planet. The new planet orbits a red star that is five times less massive than the Sun, located about 20,000 light years away, near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Its cool star and large orbit suggest the planet's surface temperature is around –220° C, which is too cold for liquid water. It may have a thin atmosphere similar to Earth’s, but its rocky surface is likely covered by frozen oceans, making it resemble a larger version of Pluto rather than the rocky inner planets like Earth and Venus.\")\n",

      "this is row Pandas(file_1=\"Centaurus A is important in the study of galaxies outside our own because it is the nearest large elliptical galaxy, the closest galaxy merger, and the nearest active galactic nucleus (AGN), located just 3.8 megaparsecs away. In terms of distance, one parsec is equivalent to 53 milliarcseconds. The radio emissions from Centaurus A can be studied across a wide range of angular scales, from its very small jets observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) to larger lobes seen over several degrees. The presence of dust in the merging spiral galaxy obscures the view of Centaurus A's center, making infrared observations essential. In 2005, Centaurus A was observed using the MIDI instrument with two combinations of telescopes: UT3–UT4 and UT2–UT3. These combinations provided two visibility measurements taken about two hours apart. The angle of the baseline for UT3–UT4 was roughly perpendicular to the radio jet observed at the parsec scale, while UT2–UT3 was aligned with the jet. The observations revealed that mid-infrared emissions are slightly resolved perpendicular to the jet with a baseline of 60 meters, but not along the jet itself. This indicates that the core's emission in the 8 to 13 µm range comes primarily from an unresolved point source (full width at half maximum less than 6 milliarcseconds), contributing 50% to 80% of the total flux at 13 µm and 8 µm. A minor extended component (with a size of roughly 30 milliarcseconds) was also identified, appearing elongated perpendicular to the radio axis. However, additional observations with improved coverage and longer baselines are needed to better determine its size and orientation. We suggest this extended component is due to dust emission from a small, tilted disc with a diameter of about 0.6 parsecs. The unresolved part is likely the non-thermal 'synchrotron core' of Centaurus A, as its flux and spectrum match the extrapolated power-law spectrum observed at millimeter wavelengths after accounting for foreground extinction. When combined with photometry at shorter wavelengths, the flux of the unresolved point source aligns with a standard synchrotron spectrum characterized by a flat power-law. We interpret this 'synchrotron core' as the base of the radio jet. Our study of Centaurus A indicates that mid-infrared radiation processes include more than just thermal dust emissions. The thermal dust emission from Centaurus A is very low, over 20 times weaker than that of the Circinus galaxy, likely due to insufficient dust in the inner parsec and a lack of a strong heating source. It is clear that Centaurus A does not have a torus blocking our view or a bright UV-optical central accretion disc. Most likely, the material accreting onto its black hole is through a flow that conserves energy poorly, resulting in little radiation output.\", file_2='Centaurus A is important in the study of galaxies outside our own because it is the nearest large elliptical galaxy, the closest galaxy merger, and the nearest example of a violent superconducting black hole. It is located 3.8 Mpc away, where 1 parsec (pc) equals 53 milliarcseconds (mas). Radio emissions can be observed at varied angular scales, from the very tight VLBI jets (a few mas) to the large outer lobes (several degrees). Dust in the merging spiral galaxy obscures views of Centaurus A’s nucleus, making infrared observations essential. In 2005, middles-infrared observations were made with the MIDI instrument using two telescopes: UT3–UT4 and UT2–UT3, covering different time windows of about two hours. The arrangement between UT3–UT4 was roughly perpendicular to the radio jet angle, while UT2–UT3 lined up with it. Findings indicate mid-infrared emission is slightly resolved at 60-metres across, perpendicular to the jet but remains unresolved along it. Thus, the emission between 8 to 13 micrometers (µm) likely originates from a point source smaller than 6 mas, accounting for 50% to 80% of the total emissions at those wavelengths. The extended source is small (about 30 mas wide), appearing elongated in the direction opposite the radio axis. More detailed coverage and longer measurements could more accurately clarify this extended source\\'s characteristics. This hazy segment might stem from dust in a small, tilted disc roughly 0.6 pc in size. The unresolved emissions are attributed to the non-thermal \"synchrotron core\" of Centaurus A based on flux levels and connections to previous satellite data. When combining this with additional observations at shorter frequencies, these emissions conform to expected synchrotron behavior seen in a fluidly resultant infall setup. Observations specify that color radiation methods in Centaurus A extend beyond conventional dust emission.

This symposium gathered 28 ESO Fellows from Chile and Germany to connect with colleagues across the ocean, discuss their research, and give feedback on ESO’s Fellowship program. Training workshops were also included this year to improve the practical skills of ESO Fellows in a competitive job market. Similar to many international organizations, ESO\\'s staff is spread out over large distances. Regular scientific exchanges between ESO\\'s offices in Germany and Chile are crucial to overcome physical and cultural differences and ensure unified cooperation between the two sites. ESO Fellows Symposia are significant for this purpose, offering events for Fellows from both regions to share research, encourage scientific collaborations, build personal relationships, and address shared interests. These meetings were created from former Fellows\\' requests for a more integrated Fellowship program. The 2009 Symposium occurred at ESO Headquarters in Garching. Throughout the three days, each Fellow presented a 20-minute overview of their ongoing research topics. The presentations depicted a variety of areas in modern astrophysics, covering everything from gamma rays to radio waves. Several staff astronomers, students, and visitors showed interest in these talks and attended to learn more about Fellows\\' studies. Many presentations prompted questions from engaged participants. This year\\'s symposium featured a new element: training workshops aimed at furthering the careers of ESO Fellows. These workshops, led by external experts and arranged with ESO\\'s Human Resources department, emphasized three main areas: interview skills, time management strategies, and effective presentation techniques. The knowledge gained and the skills practiced in these sessions will be valuable as Fellows seek jobs and pursue career paths at observatories, universities, or elsewhere.

This symposium gathered 28 ESO Fellows from Chile and Germany to connect with colleagues across the ocean, discuss their research, and give feedback on ESO’s Fellowship program. Training workshops were also included this year to improve the practical skills of ESO Fellows in a competitive job market. Like many international organizations, ESO has staff located far apart, making regular scientific communication between its offices in Germany and Chile crucial to overcoming physical and cultural barriers and ensuring effective collaboration. The ESO Fellows Symposia play an important role in this effort by bringing together Fellows from both Chile and Germany to exchange research, foster new scientific collaborations, build personal relationships, and address shared interests. These biennial events began in response to former Fellows' requests for a more integrated Fellowship program. The 2009 Symposium occurred at ESO Headquarters in Garching. Over three days, each Fellow presented a 20-minute overview of their current research interests and activities, covering various areas of modern astrophysics, from gamma rays to radio waves. Many staff astronomers, students, and visitors from ESO Garching attended to learn more about the Fellows’ research, leading to numerous questions from the audience. A significant new feature of this year’s symposium was the addition of training workshops aimed at supporting the career advancement of ESO Fellows. These workshops, conducted by external experts with assistance from ESO’s Human Resources department, focused on three main areas: job interview skills, time management strategies, and effective presentation techniques. The knowledge and skills gained from these sessions, which included practice opportunities, will be beneficial for Fellows as they seek jobs and careers at observatories, universities, or elsewhere. Social interactions have always been a vital part of the ESO Fellows Symposia, and this year was no different. Coffee breaks and lunches allowed Fellows to get acquainted in a relaxed atmosphere, with the highlight being a lively Symposium dinner at the renowned Ratskeller restaurant in central Munich. As the evening concluded and farewells were exchanged, attention began to shift toward the next ESO Fellows Symposium, planned for Santiago in 2011.

These tiny movements would be impossible to detect with most of today's spectrographs. The new planets have minimum masses ranging from 10 to 18 times that of Earth. Extensive theoretical models suggest that the inner planet is primarily rocky, while the middle one has a rocky and gas composition. The outer planet likely formed with some ice and has a core that is rocky and icy, surrounded by a considerable atmosphere. Further analyses indicate that the system is in a stable arrangement. The outer planet is positioned near the inner area of the habitable zone, where liquid water can exist on rocky or icy bodies.

Another promising tool is VEGA, a visible spectrograph and polarimeter installed on the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometer. With its combination of high spectral resolution (R = 30,000) and high angular resolution (sub-milliarcsecond) in visible wavelengths, VEGA will offer new geometric insights into Cepheid dynamics. We will also apply our data analysis methods to other classes of pulsating stars to gain further understanding of the connection between γ-asymmetries and atmospheric dynamics. Although a hydrodynamical code for pulsating stars that we are using accurately reflects atmospheric velocity gradients and provides observables, it cannot describe subtle second-order behaviors like γ-asymmetries. Thus, more numerical studies are needed to explore how convective flows and radiative transport affect Cepheid atmospheres. It is also necessary to integrate factors like mass loss, circumstellar envelopes, and the precise evolutionary state of the stars in specialized models to accurately recreate the observed spectral line profiles. Improving our understanding of Cep superconducting atmospheric dynamics has already enhanced our understanding of the Milky Way's rotation.

Unlike solar-like stars, their magnetic fields consist of large spatial scales and do not change much over the course of a year. Simulations using three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics have confirmed the presence of stable magneto-hydrodynamic structures that likely explain the long-lasting, organized magnetic fields found in these stars. In our initial survey of over 150 Ap and Bp stars, including rapidly oscillating Ap stars, we confirmed that low-resolution spectropolarimetry of hydrogen Balmer lines taken with FORS1 is an effective method for detecting stellar magnetic fields. We identified magnetic fields in 63 Ap and Bp stars during this survey. Some of these stars were included in a reevaluation of the evolutionary status of upper main-sequence magnetic stars, utilizing precise Hipparcos parallaxes. Our new findings support the earlier observation that magnetic stars with masses below 3 solar masses tend to be located toward the center of the main-sequence band, while those with masses above 3 solar masses appear closer to the zero-age main-sequence. In this study, we also found an extraordinary magnetic Ap star, HD 154708, which has the strongest longitudinal magnetic field recorded in a rapidly oscillating Ap star, with an average magnetic field strength of approximately 24.5 ± 1.0 kG. This field is about three times stronger than that of HD 166473, which has a magnetic field strength of around 5.5 to 9.0 kG, making it the second strongest roAp star. Recent measurements of HD 154708 taken with FORS1 over three months in 2008 allowed us to determine its rotation period to be 5.367 ± 0.020 days. HD 154708 is the first star studied with FORS1 that has a sufficiently uniform phase coverage to establish its magnetic period. It is important to note that the size of the error bars is similar to the size of the dots representing the individual measurements. The measurement with the highest error (6.326 ± 0.059 kG) was taken under \"thick clouds,\" which caused frequent loss of the guide star; this measurement was repeated by an observer a few nights later.', file_2='The stars known as magnetic chemically peculiar stars in spectral classes A and B (Ap and Bp stars) are currently the most researched stars regarding the strength and arrangement of their magnetic fields.

The Lya emission line, along with the break and the flatness of the continuum just past the Lya line, is clearly visible. The rest-frame equivalent width of the Lya line is about 30 Å, similar to what has been measured for emission-line LBGs at a redshift of 3. The UV continuum is reduced before the Lya line due to intergalactic HI absorption. In one galaxy, the NIV]-1485 Å emission line is also observed, suggesting the presence of HII regions with very hot ionizing stars. It will be useful to compare the characteristics of our sample, based on Lyman-break selection, with surveys that choose Lyman-a emitters using narrow-band imaging. With many spectroscopically confirmed galaxies and the UV continuum data, we can estimate the overall star-formation rate of the Universe at z~ 6 (after accounting for dust extinction) and its role in the reionization of the Universe. Additionally, GOODS encompasses more. Utilizing VLT/ISAAC and Spitzer/IRAC observations that cover the electromagnetic spectrum from 1.2 to 8 microns, along with the current high-redshift sample, we can conduct an organized study of the stellar-mass content of galaxies at z~ 6 and examine formation processes from even earlier times. The current sample will also enable us to investigate large-scale structure and the clustering characteristics of galaxies from these early periods, providing insights into the typical masses of the dark matter halos they inhabit. Thus, GOODS is offering rigorous examinations of galaxy formation models.')\n",

gaseous filaments formed at a time when the universe was very young. Before they fully develop, smooth inflows, supernova explosions, and activities from active galactic nuclei increase the disorder in the system, making it difficult for the enriched gas to remain in the shallow gravitational wells of these early groups. As the groups stabilize, their central regions grow by merging with other structures, incorporating early-type stars and enriched gas into the space between them. Over time, this leads to the formation of shared dark matter and hot gas halos. The emission of X-rays grows stronger, and the X-ray halo becomes more uniform. Eventually, the diffuse distribution of dark matter slows down the rate of mergers and moderates the evolution of these groups. Some groups eventually become fossil groups. Many low-redshift groups are just beginning to separate from the general expansion of the universe, as indicated by changes in the mass-to-light ratio over time. Specifically, the Local Group began this separation when redshift was less than 0.7. The mass-temperature and mass-luminosity relationships in X-rays for clusters and groups can help determine cosmological parameters. In summary, as groups evolve, various factors like the ratio of dwarfs to giants, the proportion of early-type galaxies, the starlight and metal content in the group, the velocity dispersion, and the mass of the central giant elliptical galaxy all increase. The metal content of the intragroup medium also grows due to the stars within the group, as their ejecta do not need to overcome significant gravitational barriers.\\n\\nObservations support this theory. Higher velocity dispersions in groups correspond to a higher number of early-type galaxies. The medium within groups can strip material from galaxies, such as NGC 2276 in the NGC 2300 group, which leads to an increase in the number of passive galaxies. Additional evidence for this evolutionary process includes the consistent distribution of velocity dispersion, which indicates a shared dark matter halo. Finally, if the early enrichment of the intragroup gas is mainly due to type II supernovae, while type Ia supernovae dominate later, this could explain the observed decrease in overall metallicity toward the edges of the group and the enhanced alpha elements found in the outer regions, as the earlier ejecta had time to spread throughout the group.')\n",

This result for NGC 7469 aligns well with a direct comparison of our VISIR data to archived spectra taken by the IRS instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which tracks down to about 3.0 arcseconds. We made similar comparisons for all objects that we observed with at least two mid-infrared filters and had accompanying IRS archival data. We encountered discrepancies between the IRS and VISIR fluxes in some instances, particularly where continuous emission was absent in the VISIR imagery. One instance is detailed in the text. We believe this inconsistency arises from smooth, extended emission that VISIR misses due to its lower sensitivity for such flux. In a few situations, temporal variations in flux between the two observing periods might contribute to this effect; however, it's unlikely to be the cause. The non-nuclear emission spotted, either directly via VISIR or via comparisons to the Spitzer results, emphasizes that focusing on high angular resolution instead of the superior sensitivity of space telescopes was ideal for our goals. While we cannot completely eliminate the possibility of significant contamination in our own data, it is assuredly less than for analyses performed with larger aperture settings. We will delve deeper into the issue of contamination in our data in the next section.\", file_2='For NGC 5135 and another object, NGC 7469, we estimate that about 45 percent of the mid-infrared (MIR) flux within the innermost 3.0 arcseconds around the active galactic nucleus (AGN) does not come from the AGN itself. For NGC 7469, this aligns well with a comparison of our VISIR data and archival spectra obtained with the IRS instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which has a resolution of about 3.0 arcseconds. We conducted this comparison for all objects where we had observations in at least two MIR filters and corresponding archival IRS data. Notably, we observed some significant differences between the IRS and VISIR fluxes in cases where no extended emission was evident in the VISIR images. One example of this is described in the text. We attribute this discrepancy to smooth, extended emission not seen in VISIR due to its limited sensitivity to such emissions. While variations in flux due to time changes between the two observation periods are unlikely to be the cause of this issue, they cannot be entirely dismissed. The extra-nuclear emission, whether detected by VISIR or inferred from the Spitzer data, emphasizes that prioritizing high angular resolution over the sensitivity of space telescopes was the correct choice for our study. Although we cannot exclude significant contamination in our data, it is expected to be much less than in larger aperture observations. We will discuss the issue of contamination in our data in more detail in the following section.')\n",

      "this is row Pandas(file_1=\"To determine the isotopic lithium abundances, we need to know the basic physical parameters that define a star's atmosphere. Accurate values for the effective temperature (Teff) are especially crucial. This temperature is usually estimated from the star's color, but interstellar reddening can skew this measurement. Instead, we have calculated Teff by comparing the observed Haline in UVES spectra with synthetic profiles for model atmospheres at different effective temperatures. Literature indicates that relative Teff values can be determined with a precision of about ± 30 K, although the absolute scale is less certain. The surface gravity of the star was estimated using its absolute magnitude (MV) derived from photometry and parallaxes, while metallicity is based on Fe II lines. Although these parameters are not critical for calculating isotopic lithium abundances, they play a role in interpreting our findings. The MV-logTeff diagram indicates that our most metal-poor stars are near the turnoff region of halo stars. By comparing with evolutionary tracks, we estimate their ages to be around 12–14 billion years, confirming that our sample represents the oldest stellar population in the galaxy. The lithium isotopic ratio was found by comparing synthetic profiles of the Li I 670.8 nm line with the observed profile. Traditional plane-parallel model atmospheres were used, but we verified that 3D hydrodynamical models yield similar or even higher 6Li/7Li ratios than 1D models. This method is documented in the literature. First, we determine the width of spectral lines affected by macro-turbulence and instrumental broadening, as shown for the Ca I 612.2 nm line.

These earlier findings align well with our data when considering the reported uncertainties and the distribution widths. The metallicity distribution is notably broad, with a total width of 0.92 dex and a standard deviation width of 0.39 dex. The complete range of metallicities spans about 3.0 dex, with some stars having metallicities close to -3 dex and others near normal levels when applying our calibration. Additional spectroscopy of these stars would be useful to reveal their detailed chemical properties, which are similar to the most metal-poor Red Giants in nearby dwarf galaxies. Some of these stars could also match the metal-rich population found in the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. While measurement errors, variations in calcium abundance (up to 0.2 dex), and calibration issues account for some of the spread, it appears that several subpopulations with different peak metallicities contribute significantly. The metallicity distribution derived here is not highly affected by the specifics of the star-formation history. However, we have linked our CaT metallicities to iron, which can come from long-lived stars via type Ia supernovae, meaning iron can be enriched without related star formation. If star formation occurs in multiple bursts with long intervals, the iron distribution may show \"gaps.\" A Gaussian analysis indicates four main populations, which is statistically supported over a single population model at 98.1 percent. Still, this analysis is somewhat arbitrary, as star formation doesn\\'t inherently create Gaussian metallicity distributions. Comparing our findings to basic chemical evolution models, like the closed-box model, indicates a G dwarf problem at low metallicities, with this model overestimating the number of metal-poor stars and failing to reproduce the prominent peak in the metallicity distribution. Improved fits might involve adding infalling, pre-enriched gas and considering significant outflows. This suggests that the recurring start-stop star formation in Carina may be due to the re-accretion of previously expelled material. More detailed chemical modeling to identify the primary processes is underway.')\n",

We observed sources with declinations below 25° and redshifts that allow strong H-band stellar absorption lines to be detected in parts of the H and K bands with good atmospheric transmission. Given that these very dusty systems benefit more from near-infrared observations than optical ones, as optical spectroscopy cannot reach the centers of most ULIRGs, we focused on the H-band, where many stellar absorption features and gas emission lines can be found. These observations require 8-meter-class telescopes with sensitive infrared spectrometers, since the absorption features are only a few percent of the continuum. The combination of the VLT and ISAAC in its medium-resolution mode proved effective for this project. We typically spent one hour observing each source per slit and analyzed at least two position angles per source. Our group had previously conducted a smaller pilot study of approximately 15 ULIRGs mainly using ISAAC on the VLT, and we included these sources in the current program, bringing the total sample size to 54 ULIRGs and 12 PG quasars, making it the most complete and unbiased dynamical analysis of these systems so far.

Electrons in the hot, magnetized plasma emit strongly polarized cyclotron radiation in optical and near-infrared light. Understanding asynchronous polars is important for clarifying how the magnetic braking mechanism quickly re-synchronizes the white dwarf’s spin with the orbital motion after nova outbursts. An intriguing case is V1432 Aql, unique among asynchronous polars because its white dwarf spin period is approximately 0.3% longer than the binary orbital period. This contradicts previous ideas that claimed transferring a small amount of angular momentum during nova events would accelerate the white dwarf's rotation. An alternative explanation may involve the slowing down of the white dwarf's rotation during the mass-loss phase due to its strong magnetic field. Observations from XMM-Newton and ASCA reveal a triple-hump profile, suggesting the presence of three hot spots on the white dwarf’s surface, marking V1432 Aql as an important subject for further investigation. Circular spectro-polarimetry of V1432 was conducted with EFOSC2 on June 28, 2007, capturing rapid fluctuations of positive and negative circular polarization as the visibility of the cyclotron emission regions changes with the rotation of the white dwarf and our viewing angle relative to the magnetic field lines. The patterns in the circular polarization indicate the existence of two dominant negative poles during the observations and show that emissions occur at locations fairly far from the magnetic poles. Also, the accretion pattern shifts in sync with the variations between the white dwarf's spin and the orbital periods. These findings illustrate that circular polarimetry is a valuable method for examining the magnetic field and accretion structure in magnetic cataclysmic variables, allowing detections of circular polarization variations as small as 0.1% or less with EFOSC2.\", file_2=\"Polars are a type of magnetic cataclysmic variable that feature a highly magnetic white dwarf pulling in matter from a low-mass companion star. The white dwarf spins in sync with its orbit. The strong magnetic field of the white dwarf stops an accretion disc from forming. Instead, matter follows the magnetic field lines and lands on the surface of the white dwarf through accretion columns. The temperature of the accretion shock is around 10 to 40 keV, and hot, magnetized plasma with mildly relativistic electrons emits strongly polarized cyclotron radiation in the optical and near-infrared ranges. Asynchronous polars help us understand the magnetic braking mechanism that quickly re-synchronizes the white dwarf's spin with its orbital motion after nova explosions. A particularly notable system is V1432 Aql, which stands out because the spin period of the white dwarf is about 0.3% longer than the binary orbital cycle. This contradicts previous ideas that suggested synchronism is disrupted by the transfer of a small amount of orbital angular momentum during the common-envelope phase of a nova eruption, which should speed up the spin. Another explanation may involve the white dwarf's rotation slowing during mass loss due to the strong magnetic field. The triple-hump pattern seen in the light curves from XMM-Newton and ASCA indicates that there are three hot spots on the surface of the white dwarf. These characteristics make V1432 Aql significant for further research. Circular spectro-polarimetry of V1432 was conducted with EFOSC2 on June 28, 2007. The observations revealed rapid changes in positive and negative circular polarization, influenced by the visibility of the cyclotron emission areas on the rotating white dwarf and the angle between our viewpoint and the magnetic field lines. The circular polarization patterns suggest the presence of two dominant negative poles during these observations, with the magnetic field lines at the cyclotron emission area notably inclined from the white dwarf's normal, indicating that accretion occurs relatively far from the magnetic poles. The geometry of accretion also shifts during the beat period of the white dwarf's spin and orbital cycles. These findings show that circular polarimetry effectively probes the magnetic field and accretion geometry in magnetic cataclysmic variables, and that EFOSC2 can detect circular polarization variations as small as 0.1% or less.\")\n",

This paper introduces a new observing approach that, along with a new data reduction technique, could potentially double the multiplexing capacity of VIMOS while still producing spectra of quality similar to those achieved in previous major surveys. Modern spectroscopic surveys typically rely on multi-object observations, where many dozens to hundreds of objects are observed at once with each telescope pointing, enabling quicker completion of projects that obtain spectra from thousands of objects. However, achieving such a high level of multiplexing often conflicts with the requirements for obtaining high-quality spectra for each object observed. This paper outlines a new observing strategy and a tailored data reduction method for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS), aimed at boosting the multiplexing of MOS observations without significantly compromising the quality of the resulting spectra. In the ideal scenario of a deep survey with numerous potential targets, this new strategy could allow for a doubling of multiplexing in VIMOS MOS observations.', file_2='Enhancing VIMOS Multiplexing for Future Spectroscopic Surveys \\n\\nTo tackle the adverse effects of fringing on VIMOS spectra, astronomers documented techniques that severely restrict the multiplexing capability of VIMOS in multi-object spectroscopy mode.

Advancements in understanding depend on new technology, particularly ALMA.

This includes the formation and direction of outflows, as well as how circumstellar discs evolve into planetary systems, asteroids, and comets. The role of magnetic fields is thought to be significant, but is not yet fully understood. Frédéric Gueth shared recent findings from high-resolution molecular outflow observations using the IRAM interferometer and emphasized that ALMA will be able to visualize the central areas of young stellar objects, revealing the complex structure and motion of both outflowing and accumulating material. Stephane Guilloteau discussed how ALMA could enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of circumstellar discs, offering detailed images of the physical conditions, kinematics, and chemical changes within these discs by capturing multiple lines of various molecules at high resolution. ALMA will also be able to directly image the gaps predicted to form in circumstellar discs due to planet formation.

      "this is row Pandas(file_1='The idea that supernovae (SNe) might be connected to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originated with Colgate. This prediction has been confirmed in recent years through extensive optical and near-infrared observations of GRB afterglows found by BeppoSAX. Research has demonstrated that long-duration GRBs, or at least many of them, are related to the collapse of massive stars. The strongest evidence comes from observing supernova features in the spectra of certain GRB afterglows. In other instances, signs of a supernova are based on late-time brightness increases seen in fading optical afterglows. Notable examples of this SN/GRB relationship include SN 1998bw/GRB 980425, SN 2003dh/GRB 030329, and SN 2003lw/GRB 031203. The average redshift of Swift GRBs is quite high, making it challenging to find an associated supernova. GRB 050525A, at redshift z = 0.606, is the first supernova linked to a GRB identified by Swift. Early photometric observations have been used to estimate the photometric redshift. The light curve, plotted for different optical and near-infrared bands, reveals a flattening starting about five days after the GRB explosion, followed by a significant dimming. The magnitude and duration of the flattening suggest a supernova component, which is slightly dimmer than the typical SN 1998bw and features a quicker rise to peak brightness. An early spectrum collected by Foley and colleagues using Gemini North and GMOS shows that GRB 050525A occurred in a star-forming galaxy. A spectrum taken with VLT UT1 + FORS2 during the flattening reveals strong similarities to the spectrum of SN 1998bw about five days post-maximum. Thus, this instance also shows a connection between a supernova and a gamma-ray burst. With a calculated frequency of about 4 × 10–6 GRBs per galaxy per year when accounting for jet angle, the overall rate is approximately 4 × 10–4 GRBs per galaxy per year, roughly 1/30th that of Ibc supernovae. Although establishing a clear SN/GRB connection has advanced GRB research, it also raises new questions. It remains to be seen whether this association is limited to bright supernovae, as suggested by cases with confirmed spectra, or if it includes fainter type-Ibc supernovae as well, which will require further observations. By analyzing a sufficiently large sample, we may eventually uncover the physical mechanism behind this connection and understand how these explosions progress over time. The short GRBs 050709 and 050724 show no signs of a supernova, despite being relatively nearby.', file_2='The idea that supernovae (SNe) might be connected to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originated with Colgate. This prediction has been confirmed in recent years due to extensive optical and near-infrared follow-up observations of GRB afterglows found by BeppoSAX. These observations have clearly shown that long-duration GRBs, or a significant portion of them, are linked to the death of massive stars. Strong evidence stems from supernova characteristics observed in the spectra of some GRB afterglows, while in several other instances, signs of a SN are inferred from late-time optical brightness increases in declining afterglows. Notable cases supporting the SN/GRB link include SN 1998bw/GRB 980425, SN 2003dh/GRB 030329, and SN 2003lw/GRB 031203. The high average redshift of Swift GRBs complicates the detection of associated SNe. GRB 050525A observed at redshift z = 0.606 is the first SN identified connected to a GRB discovered by Swift. Early photometric observations helped estimate the redshift, with its light curve appearing in the figure’s inset showing measurements first recorded with TNG and NTT, and later with VLT. These revealed a plateau commencing about five days post-GRB before a rapid drop-off in brightness, suggesting a SN component that is slightly less bright than SN 1998bw but also grows more quickly to maximum brightness.

It converts two incoming signals, one for each polarization, at a rate of 4 gigasamples per second and organizes them into six 16-bit words at 250 megahertz. These words are sent to the Data Encoder, which prepares them for optical transmission. The main component of the Digitizer Assembly is the VEGA digitizer chip, which is a 3-bit flash analog-to-digital converter operating between 2 and 4 GHz at the same sampling rate of 4 gigasamples per second. Currently, while some market components meet certain requirements, no suitable combination of sampling rate, resolution, maximum input frequency (4 GHz), and power consumption is available. Thus, a custom application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was developed. Power dissipation is a crucial factor because the low air density at the operating altitude makes cooling inefficient. Additionally, the Digitizer Assembly must be enclosed in a sealed case to minimize radio frequency interference. To achieve high speed and low power usage, the digitizer employs Silicon-Germanium technology and a BiCMOS 0.25 μm process, enabling the creation of high-speed, low-power hybrid analog/digital devices. It operates on a nominal voltage of 2.5 V with an average power consumption of 1.5 W. The device is designed for high temporal stability, essential for radio astronomy. It includes a self-diagnostic feature to ensure the outputs are functioning correctly after manufacturing or during maintenance. A related demultiplexing chip, PHOBOS, was also created. It organizes an incoming 4 Gbit/s serial stream into 16-bit words at 250 MHz. Three PHOBOS chips are connected to the three output lines of VEGA. Although PHOBOS has more complexity, higher pin counts, and a lower maximum power dissipation of less than 1 W per chip, its development was less critical because it is entirely digital and contains no analog components. VEGA and PHOBOS were developed through a collaboration between the Observatoire de Bordeaux, the IXL Laboratory of the Université de Bordeaux, and a commercial partner. The two institutes handled all design, simulations, and qualification testing, while the commercial partner supplied software tools and production capabilities.', file_2='The ALMA Digitizer Assembly is a component of the Data Transmission System that converts two incoming signals (one for each polarization) into digital form at a speed of 4 billion samples per second (4Gsamples/s) and arranges them into six 16-bit words at 250 MHz.

A recent ADP initiative processed and released the ISAAC/GOODS data using EIS/MVM software, which includes science and calibration frames that are photometrically calibrated with pre-set zero points from SOFI data. These data can be found on the ESO website. Ingesting ADP into a VO-compliant SAF will include products from both the ADP group and the community, such as science-ready data from various ESO projects that are currently available in different formats on specialized web pages. As of Period 75, Principals Investigators of Large Programmes are asked to submit their reduced data products to ESO when publishing their results. Additionally, Public Survey data products will also be added and published in a VO-compliant manner, as they will be very beneficial for VO users due to their high level of consistency and calibration. This will involve data from OmegaCAM on the VLT Survey Telescope and from VISTA. For the publication of ADP within the VO infrastructure, a complete redesign of the SAF and its interface will be necessary. As a first step, on April 4, 2005, the ESO archive was made globally accessible with a revamped interface aimed at helping users unfamiliar with ESO instruments. This new interface is available at the ESO archive.

This allowed for a deep integration of 6 hours on the source, achieving a spatial resolution of about 0.15 arcseconds, or 1.2 kiloparsecs at the galaxy's redshift. This offers the most detailed view of the Hα morphology and kinematics for a system at z ~ 2 so far. The Hα emission of BzK-15504 shares many features with some of our BM/BX objects, but with three times better spatial resolution, and there are notable differences as well. The morphology is clumpy, embedded in a more diffuse, low-surface brightness component that extends over nearly 2 arcminutes (16 kiloparsecs), but it is generally symmetric along the major axis and centralized on the peak continuum. In the outer regions, the velocity field appears smooth, and the rotation curve levels off at distances of about 8–10 kiloparsecs, providing strong evidence for a rotating disk. In the inner few kiloparsecs, the twist in the isovelocity contours compared to the larger pattern indicates radial flows that may be connected to material inflow toward the center, or an outflow potentially driven by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in this galaxy. However, the AGN does not clearly dominate the overall Hα line emission and kinematics, and there are no obvious indications of a major merger. BzK-15504 seems to be a large, massive, gas-rich clumpy disk that may be in the process of channeling gas toward a central growing bulge and fueling an AGN.\", file_2='We recently acquired impressive data on a large star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 2.38, published in the 17 August issue of Nature.

In the outer regions, the velocity outlines appear smooth, and the rotation curve levels out between 8 and 10 kpc, providing strong evidence for a rotating disk. Meanwhile, in the innermost few kiloparsecs, the deformation of the isovelocity lines in comparison to the larger trend implies radial movements which could indicate gas inflows toward the center, and/or outflows possibly linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) present in this galaxy. However, the AGN is clearly not the primary source of the overall Ha line emission and dynamics. No significant evidence of a major merger was found.

The reduced errors in our larger sample, compared to the smaller sample from Rollinde et al., indicate that we can derive meaningful constraints on ΩL. Achieving this will require a larger sample and a thorough analysis of systematic uncertainties using extensive hydrodynamical simulations. McDonald estimated that we would need 13 pairs over distances of up to 10 arcminutes. Furthermore, our results suggest the potential to directly reconstruct the 3D density field, which would require observing a network of sightlines within the same area.

Eight stars were observed with high spectral and time resolution, achieving a high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of about 300. To depict the dynamic behavior of Cepheid oscillating atmospheres, we carefully chose 17 spectral lines formed at different layers of the atmosphere. The profile of these spectral lines, especially their asymmetry, is significantly influenced by the pulsation of the Cepheid atmosphere and various factors such as limb-darkening, velocity differences in the line-forming area, turbulence, rotation, and the movement of that region against the mass elements nearby. As the line-forming area shifts in relation to the overall atmospheric structure, it also interacts with the background velocity field. All these physical influences fluctuate throughout the pulsation cycle. For all selected lines across the stars, we collected data on radial velocity and line asymmetry. For modeling radial velocity, when the S/N ratio permits, we utilized the first moment of the spectral line profile. This method provides a radial velocity curve that is unaffected by spectral line width or rotation, making it extremely useful for comparing different lines in various Cepheids. We also achieved a high level of precision in measuring spectral line asymmetries using a new method we named the bi-Gaussian, fitting two separate semi-Gaussians to the blue and red sections of the spectral line profile.

and employees regarding their experiences at high altitude. This questionnaire was made available to all visitors and workers at the ALMA and APEX sites, with 28 responses received. The first section collects work-related background information. Participants are asked about their frequency of high-altitude exposure and their preparations for such conditions. They can also mention any unusual incidents at high-altitude work settings and whether they experienced any work-related limitations possibly due to altitude (e.g., “Did you face any restrictions in planning and coordination?”). This serves as an introduction to potential risk areas, which are explored further in the second part of section one. Here, participants indicate the degree to which they encountered 17 physical and psychological issues on a scale from 1 = extremely to 5 = not at all (e.g., feelings like anger or irritability). The third section of the first part asks participants to evaluate the effects of high altitude on their abilities, work behavior, and performance, using a scale from 1 = strongly impaired to 5 = strongly improved (e.g., ability item: “Perceptual speed: the ability to quickly and accurately compare information”; work behavior item: “Driving a car”; performance item: “Job performance capability”). This final section aims to assess potential performance issues at high altitude. \\n\\nThe second part of the questionnaire focuses on occupational safety and health (OSH) programs and their perceived effectiveness. In the first section of part two, participants are asked to list all safety-related resources they utilized and any other support (e.g., “Briefing by Supervisor”) that helped them prepare for high-altitude work. They are also asked to estimate the time spent on each resource and how beneficial they found them for high-altitude tasks. In the second section, participants describe and rate the document or support they found most beneficial. The third part includes a “Performance and Well-being Diary” with three tables. The first table allows participants to assess their average daily workload before, during, and after their mission, while the second table addresses how that workload was managed. The third table records well-being before, during, and after the mission. So far, this last section of the returned questionnaires has not been thoroughly completed and will be addressed in a future report.')\n",

ESO astronomers were surprised to find that the ejected piece from fragment B was breaking up again, with five other small comets also visible. The comet appears likely to disintegrate, but it’s unclear how long this will take. Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 (SW 3) orbits the Sun in about 5.4 years, taking an elongated path that reaches from near Earth’s orbit to the vicinity of Jupiter. In 1995, as it approached Earth, the comet experienced an unexpected brightening a thousand times its usual brightness. Observations in 1996 with ESO’s NTT and 3.6-meter telescope found that it had split into three distinct pieces, with two additional fragments discovered later that year in December. During its most recent pass, only three of the five original fragments (C, B, and E) were still visible, and no new fragmentation occurred then. However, this time, as the comet approached the Sun and Earth again, seven fragments were spotted in early March, with fragment C at magnitude 12 and fragment B being much fainter. On March 6, new fragments were reported, and by early April, fragment B had brightened tenfold. On April 7, six additional fragments were noted, showcasing the comet's significant fragmentation. By April 12, fragment B was as bright as fragment C at magnitude 9, appearing to split again, leading to close to 40 fragments total with many likely being small, boulder-sized objects with short-lived brightness. New observations indicated that a smaller fragment connected to B had also split again. An analysis showed five tiny pieces closely aligned beneath the main B fragment, indicating at least seven fragments. This suggests that the comet has produced a lot of mini-comets. The fate of the comet is still uncertain—whether the fragmentation process will continue or if it will fully break apart remains to be seen. Additional observations are planned. The GIT images mentioned were obtained with FORS1 on the VLT, tracking the comet over 30 minutes across four bands (B, V, R, and I), which created trails of colored dots for each band, showing the order of observation. At such observations, the comet was approximately 26.6 million kilometers from Earth in the constellation Corona Borealis.\", file_2=\"VLT Images of a Disintegrating Comet  \\nFrom the night of April 23 to 24, the VLT observed fragment B of comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, which had recently split.

It appears that the comet is on track to completely disintegrate, but the duration of this process is still uncertain. Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 (SW 3) orbits the Sun in about 5.4 years, following a highly elongated path that takes it from within the Earth's orbit to near Jupiter. In 1995, as it approached Earth, the comet unexpectedly brightened a thousandfold. Observations in 1996 using ESO's NTT and 3.6-meter telescope revealed that it had split into three separate pieces. Two additional fragments were found in December 1996. During its last pass, only three of the five fragments (C, B, and E) were still visible, and no new fragmentation occurred then. However, this time, as the comet approached the Sun and Earth again, seven fragments were detected in early March, with the brightest, fragment C, having a magnitude of 12, while fragment B was ten times fainter. On March 6, more new fragments were observed. By early April, fragment B had an outburst, increasing in brightness by ten times, and on April 7, six new fragments were identified, indicating significant fragmentation. By April 12, fragment B matched the brightness of the main fragment C, reaching a magnitude around 9. Fragment B appeared to break apart again, increasing the total number of fragments to nearly 40, with some likely being small boulder-sized objects with short-lived activity. New observations showed that a small fragment had split again, revealing a tiny fragment divided into two and five small fragments aligned almost perfectly. This alone indicates at least seven fragments. The comet has thus created a series of mini-comets. Will this process continue? Will the comet completely disintegrate? Additional observations are planned. The reported observations were conducted with FORS1 on the VLT, capturing the fragment in four filters (B, V, R, and I) for a total of 30 minutes. The telescope tracked the comet, resulting in the stars appearing as streaks of colored dots, with each color corresponding to the order of observations in the different filters.

This stretching is necessary to ensure that the pixels (or \"spaxels\") on the sky are square while keeping proper sampling on the detector for different wavelengths. Groups of 8 subfields are aligned and combined into a single slit for each of the three spectrometers. The design is based on the Advanced Image Slicer concept and benefits from the experience gained from building the GNIRS integral-field unit for Gemini South. To improve surface quality, three off-axis aspheres are used in the front optics, made using diamond-turning instead of raster fly-cutting. Key design considerations for the 24 optical paths included manufacturability and using single-piece optical components when possible. In the current design, all slicer mirrors are spherical with identical curvature, as are the pupil mirrors. The slit mirrors are toroidal, sharing the same curvature in the spectral direction but differing in the spatial direction. This choice aligns well with available machining techniques. Each IFU sub-module generates a 254 mm long slit that contains 112 slices from 8 subfields.

The slices from sets of 8 subfields are properly aligned and combined into a single slit for each of the three spectrometers. The optical design is based on the Advanced Image Slicer concept and builds on experience from constructing the GNIRS integral-field unit for Gemini South. The fore-optics use three off-axis aspheres allowing for a manufacturing method of diamond-turning to enhance the surface roughness as opposed to raster fly-cutting. When designing the 24 optical trains, manufacturability was a key factor in optimizing the process along with a preference for using single-piece optical components wherever possible. Current design incorporates all spherical slicer mirrors and pupil mirrors with the same radius of curvature. The slit mirrors are toroidal, featuring consistent curvature in the spectral direction but different curvatures in the spatial direction. This design is well-suited for the available machining techniques. Each IFU sub-module creates a 254 mm long slit that contains 112 individual slices from 8 subfields.

This gathering provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate FLAMES' impact on various areas of astrophysical research and for ESO to understand the current and future requirements of FLAMES users. We summarize the two-and-a-half-day meeting, in which participants shared their experiences and expertise with FLAMES. FLAMES has successfully operated for six years as part of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the La Silla Paranal Observatory. Its large field of view combined with numerous diverse fibres, totaling 1.6 km if lined up, makes FLAMES a unique asset in ground-based astronomy. Due to its flexibility, FLAMES can serve many astronomical purposes, including extrasolar planet discovery, analysis of chemical abundances in star groups, studying kinematics and dark matter, examining planetary nebulae, surveying the interstellar medium, and exploring stellar evolution. We felt it was important to review FLAMES' performance over these six years. After the positive experience with UVES nearly six years ago, FLAMES users were invited to an informal workshop at ESO Headquarters in December 2008, and it was encouraging to see nearly all teams that had used FLAMES present. Participants presented their scientific findings and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using FLAMES for their research, which were compiled for the final discussion. Additionally, some technical talks were given by community members, and the FLAMES Instrument and Operations Team shared usage statistics. Over the six years of operation, approximately 9000 science frames were obtained, averaging 100 objects per image, equating to around 400 nights of VLT time. This accounts for about 25% of the time available on Kueyen and is similar to the proportion of UT2 time requested when submitting proposals.\")\n",

This programme works alongside the Space Programme, which emphasizes developing scientific instruments for astronomy and Solar System missions and their use. The National Plan provides several funding options, including direct research costs, PhD fellowships, technical trainee contracts, postdoctoral contracts of various levels, and more. One significant method of support is funding for 3 to 5 year projects, which commonly represents the largest financial contribution to astronomy groups.

The Astronomy & Astrophysics Programme, established in 2000, aims to: conduct basic research in astronomy and astrophysics, design and develop astronomical instruments, utilize existing facilities, and research and develop technologies related to astronomy. This program works alongside the Space Programme, which emphasizes developing scientific instruments for astronomy and Solar System missions and their scientific use. The National Plan includes various funding options, such as covering direct research costs, providing PhD fellowships, technical trainee contracts, postdoctoral contracts at different levels, and more. A key feature is funding for projects lasting 3 to 5 years, which often contributes significantly to astronomy groups. Project funding is allocated based on a rigorous peer-review process, and an overall ranking is established by a national program board. Funding for infrastructures, particularly what are referred to as “singular scientific infrastructures” (which for astronomy includes telescopes), comes from separate sources and is budgeted individually. An Advisory Committee on Singular Infrastructures recommends, evaluates, and oversees these at the national level.')\n",

However, we are also interested in the smaller-scale structure of individual galaxy groups, which we define as galaxies that are influenced by the gravitational pull of a single virialized dark matter halo. The zCOSMOS survey is particularly suitable for this analysis because it has a relatively high sampling rate compared to other surveys, especially in the final sample of 20,000. Various algorithms have been created in the literature to identify galaxy groups in redshift surveys. We have thoroughly tested these algorithms using the zCOSMOS mock catalogs, which replicate the complex selection function of the actual survey and provide information about the host dark matter halo for every galaxy. By optimizing our methods against these realistic mock catalogs, we gain a solid understanding of the statistical properties of our group catalog, specifically regarding ‘purity’ and ‘completeness’—the likelihood that the identified groups are real and that any actual group will be detected. We also consider the equivalent ‘interloper fraction’ and ‘completeness’ for individual galaxy members of these groups. Compared to previous methods in the literature, we improve the accuracy of the group catalog by implementing a multi-pass strategy that adjusts the group-finding parameters to better identify increasingly smaller groups, and by using and combining two different techniques: the linking length based “friends-of-friends” method and a Voronoi–Delauney tessellation approach. With our enhancements, even the initial 10k sample has achieved a notably high fidelity in the group catalog, surpassing other studies at these redshifts. The catalog will further improve as the number of spectroscopic redshifts doubles in the upcoming 20k sample. So far, we have identified 151 groups with four or more spectroscopically confirmed members, in addition to 649 groups with two or three members. The zCOSMOS group catalog is already among the largest and most accurately defined catalogs of galaxy groups at high redshift. At low redshifts around z ~ 0.3, about one-third of the galaxies in the 10k sample can be categorized into a group. This percentage decreases to about 15% at z ~ 0.8, partly because the higher redshift galaxies are brighter and only more intrinsically rich groups will be detected, and also because there are fewer groups at fixed richness due to hierarchical structure growth on these scales.', file_2='The previously discussed density field operates on large scales, over one comoving Mpc.

      "this is row Pandas(file_1='Research on gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies is revealing new information about galaxy formation that was previously little understood. This is because GRB host galaxies are typically faint and found at high redshifts. Finding similar galaxies using standard methods is very challenging, as it would need long observation times, even with the best telescopes. GRB events provide a quicker way to discover faint and distant galaxies. They are identified as brief, intense phenomena, and their locations (and sometimes their redshifts) are determined from the bright X-ray and optical afterglow. Long-duration GRBs are known to occur in star-forming regions, linking them to galaxies. Specific programs can help complete these investigations. In our GHostS search, we aim to study various important galaxy characteristics, such as metallicity, star formation rate, stellar mass, age of the stellar population, and dust extinction. Each of these characteristics is challenging to measure due to the faintness of typical GRB hosts and the inconsistency of data collected by researchers. Additionally, the methods used to estimate these physical properties can have systematic errors that may overshadow the intended findings. Typically, GRB hosts are star-forming galaxies with low mass and low metallicity, observed at redshifts below z = 2. The average stellar mass found in our sample is comparable to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Observational limitations hinder us from thoroughly examining the same characteristics in GRBs at higher redshifts, except in rare cases. The detection of cold interstellar medium in high-redshift hosts suggests that these galaxies may differ, showing greater stellar masses, higher star formation rates, and higher metallicities. It remains unclear whether this indicates a different population or simply different observational biases. Future telescopes and instruments will address these challenges. Overall, we recognize that GRB hosts are unique galaxies. It is still uncertain if this uniqueness arises from the limitations of our traditional observational techniques or if GRB hosts are inherently different. The major constraint is the small number of identified galaxies to date, which is still fewer than 100, in contrast to the over 100,000 galaxies found in current surveys.', file_2='Research on gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies is now revealing information about galaxy formation that was once little understood. This is because GRB host galaxies are typically faint and found at high distances from us. It is hard to locate similar galaxies using typical methods due to the long observation times required, even with the best telescopes. However, GRB events allow for the detection of a greater number of these faint and distant galaxies. They are identified during short, bright bursts of energy, and we can gauge their location and distance based on the luminous afterglow in X-rays and visible light. Long-duration GRBs occur where star formation happens, linking them to galaxies. Targeted research programs can then gather more observational data. Our GHostS project aims to analyze key galaxy features, such as metallicity, star formation rate, stellar mass, stellar population age, and dust extinction; superconducting capable conclusion. However, each feature is tough to estimate, partly due to the faintness of typical GRB hosts and inconsistencies in the wide range of combined existing data.

      "this is row Pandas(file_1='By the mid-1990s, the potential of the submillimetre wavelength range was proven through the early successes of the 15-meter James Clerk Maxwell telescope and the 10.4-meter Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, both located at 4000 meters on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. During this period, plans for a large millimetre interferometer array were made in North America, Europe, and Japan, accompanied by extensive site testing. Through these efforts, the 5100-meter high Llano de Chajnantor was identified as likely the best easily reachable site on Earth for submillimetre astronomy outside of Antarctica. The favorable weather data for this location led to the expansion of the original interferometer concept. Consequently, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) was designed to include both millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths that transmitted well to the ground. Confident in the quality of the Chajnantor site, Karl Menten successfully persuaded the Max-Planck-Society to provide funding for an ALMA prototype antenna to be established there as an initial project. ESO and the Onsala Space Observatory were seen as logical collaborators since they had been running the successful 15-meter Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope at the lower-altitude site in La Silla since 1987. The new ESO Director General, Catherine Cesarsky, and Onsala Space Observatory Director Roy Booth were both enthusiastic about the proposal, leading to the creation of the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. Following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between all partners on July 20, 2001, MPIfR hired VERTEX Antennen-technik GmbH in Germany to design and build the telescope. Construction began in spring 2003, with commissioning starting in spring 2004. After confirming that the telescope met expected performance standards, the facility was officially inaugurated on September 25, 2005. Once operational, the management of the facility was assigned to ESO, transferring responsibility from Rolf Güsten to Station Manager Lars-Åke Nyman.', file_2=\"By the mid-1990s, the potential of the submillimetre wavelength range was proven through the early successes of the 15-meter James Clerk Maxwell telescope and the 10.4-meter Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, both located at 4000 meters on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. During this period, plans for a large millimetre interferometer array were developed in North America, Europe, and Japan, accompanied by extensive site testing. Through these efforts, the 5100-meter high Llano de Chajnantor was identified as possibly the best accessible site on Earth for submillimetre astronomy, outside of Antarctica. The favorable weather conditions at this location led to an expansion of the initial interferometer concept, resulting in the planning of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which aimed to cover all millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths with good ground transmission. Recognizing the quality of the Chajnantor site, Karl Menten successfully persuaded the Max-Planck-Society to provide funding for an early deployment of one of the ALMA prototype antennas to Chajnantor as a test for ALMA. ESO and the Onsala Space Observatory were ideal partners for this project, given their success with the 15-meter Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope since 1987 at a lower altitude in La Silla.

It achieves a resolving power of 19,000 over a continuous spectral range from 390 to 750 nm. The instrument's total throughput, including the telescope and detector, reaches a peak of 11% at 500 nm. This efficiency allows for the collection of spectra from stars of visual magnitude 5 with a 15-minute exposure time and a signal-to-noise ratio of 50. One aim of the instrument is to track the spectral changes in Balmer emission lines of Be stars. The availability of essential components like diffraction gratings and high-sensitivity CCD cameras at low prices has made it possible to build affordable, high-performance spectrographs. Many amateur astronomers now regularly capture spectra of planets, stars, comets, and bright extended objects. Several years ago, we began creating low-resolution spectrographs for small telescopes. These earlier models were heavy and bulky, requiring optical fibers to connect to the telescope. The first prototype, FIASCO, used a 200 µm fiber attached to a 25-cm telescope with a Peltier-cooled CCD camera and a 600 l/mm grating, yielding spectra with a resolving power of 600. Even with this setup, we detected sodium lines in the comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp in 1996 and 1997. Currently, the amateur spectroscopy community is seeking higher resolving power for more ambitious scientific endeavors, such as studying the spectral variability of Balmer emission lines in Be stars and even discovering exoplanets. In response to this trend, we designed an echelle spectrograph light enough to attach directly to small telescopes. The weight limit is 2 kg (excluding the CCD camera), and the size should be compatible with typical amateur telescopes. By using cost-effective echelle gratings and lightweight CCD cameras, we met these goals. The instrument was developed through collaboration between a group from ESO and the Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik's mechanical workshop for apprentices in Garching. The first observations with BACHES took place in September 2006, focusing on bright stars like Albireo and Deneb using a 35-cm Celestron telescope.

strong stellar winds and supernova explosions. Detecting massive stars in distant Lyman-break galaxies, either by observing their ultraviolet light or by studying ionized hydrogen regions, imposes strict limits on their characteristics. The Initial Mass Function indicates that low- and intermediate-mass stars are more likely to form than high-mass stars, with the boundary set at 8 solar masses. This boundary separates stars that will become CO white dwarfs from those that will develop iron cores, leading to a core-collapse supernova. Spectroscopically, stars with masses between 8 and 20 solar masses are classified as B-type or O-type dwarfs. These high-mass stars have convective cores and radiative outer layers, which is the opposite of what occurs in the Sun and other low-mass stars. While energy is transferred between the layers, only the convective core is involved in nuclear reactions, unless hydrogen from outer layers mixes into the core. Once the hydrogen in the core is depleted, the star exits the main sequence, becoming a blue supergiant and eventually a red supergiant for stars with initial masses of 20 to 30 solar masses. There are very few bright red supergiants observed, known as the Humphreys-Davidson limit, suggesting that more massive stars skip the red supergiant stage, moving instead through a Luminous Blue Variable phase, and then ending as Wolf-Rayet stars, which can show features from core hydrogen burning or core helium burning. Thus, red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars are the main candidates for core-collapse supernovae in hydrogen-rich (Type II) and hydrogen-poor (Type Ib/c) cases, respectively. Recently, a link has been made between some Type Ic supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, supporting the idea that gamma-ray bursts arise from the collapse of rapidly rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. The evolution of high-mass stars is more complex than that of low-mass stars due to the influence of metallicity on their stellar winds, which become weaker at low metallicity, and their initial rotation speeds, which cause mixing within the star. Only in the last decade have both factors been considered in evolutionary models, most recently in spectral synthesis models.')\n",

The high spatial resolution of an ELT will enable us to investigate the \"sphere of influence\" of black holes at great distances and measure their abundance and masses. Collaboration with VLTI and JWST is particularly crucial. Astronomy is well-suited to analyze dark energy and inflation effects, as well as contribute to our understanding of dark matter and physics laws.

This direct measurement should correlate with geometrical observations, such as those from supernovae, providing a vital test of our Universe model and its foundation in general relativity. A highly stable, high-resolution spectrograph would also enhance the accuracy of measuring changes in fundamental constants, such as the fine structure constant, by two orders of magnitude compared to current methods. This measurement is crucial, as variations could indicate extra dimensions as suggested by string theory and differentiate between dynamic dark energy models and Einstein\\'s cosmological constant.

(2) What exactly is dark matter—could it be a known massive particle or something entirely different?

      "this is row Pandas(file_1=\"The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) for the ESO/VLT telescope is an important advancement towards an ideal instrument. MUSE is being developed by a group of six major European institutes. It is an integral-field spectrograph (IFU) that offers a wide field of view, high spatial resolution, medium resolving power, and a large simultaneous spectral range. Integral-field spectroscopy is now commonly used in modern telescopes, but most existing integral-field spectrographs have a limited field of view and focus on detailed studies of individual objects. Some multi-IFUs, like Giraffe at the VLT, can observe about a dozen objects at once, increasing their efficiency without changing the standard three-step process of imaging, selection, and spectrography. MUSE has three modes of operation: a wide-field mode that can operate with or without adaptive optics correction, and a narrow-field mode providing high spatial resolution. The observational details are shown in Table 1. The total amount of data collected is calculated by multiplying the number of spaxels (90,000) by the number of spectral pixels (4000), resulting in 360 million elements in the final data cubes. Such a high pixel count cannot be handled by a single optics piece and detector, so MUSE consists of 24 identical modules, each containing an advanced slicer, a spectrograph, and a 4k detector. Various fore-optics, along with splitting and relay optics, separate and rearrange the square field of view into 24 subfields, positioned on the Nasmyth platform between the VLT's focal plane and the IFU modules. Adaptive optics correction will be provided by the VLT's deformable secondary mirror. Four sodium laser guide stars, along with one natural star for tip/tilt adjustment, are used; all guide stars are located outside the scientific field of view to reduce scattered light. The only optic within the scientific field is an innovative Na notch filter, which minimizes transmission losses compared to traditional adaptive optics systems. This complex adaptive optics setup is part of the wider VLT adaptive optics facility, with the specific MUSE component called GALACSI. In the narrow-field mode, an additional optical system is added to the fore-optics to refine the spatial sampling from 0.2 arcsec to 0.025 arcsec, which reduces the field of view to 7.5 × 7.5 arcsec. The main changes involve adjusting the adaptive optics configuration (bringing the laser guide stars closer) and performing tip/tilt operations at infrared wavelengths using either a natural guide star in the field or the target object itself. With this configuration, the adaptive optics facility aims to deliver a diffraction-limited image with a Strehl ratio of 5% (goal is 10%) at 0.75 µm.\", file_2=\"The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) for the ESO/VLT telescope is an important advancement towards creating an ideal instrument. MUSE is developed by a group of six major European institutes.

Integral-field spectroscopy is now commonly used in modern telescopes, but most current spectrographs have a limited field of view intended for detailed studies of individual objects. Some multi-IFUs, like the VLT's Giraffe, can capture data from multiple objects at once, increasing their efficiency without changing the general three-step process of imaging, selection, and spectrography.

The total amount of data is created by multiplying the number of spaxels (90,000) by the number of spectral pixels (4000), resulting in 360 million elements in total. Having so many pixels is impractical for a single optical device and detector; thus, MUSE consists of 24 identical modules, each made up of a slicer, spectrograph, and a 4k detector. A series of optics rotates and divides the field of view into 24 subfields. These are positioned on the Nasmyth platform, situated between the VLT's focal plane and the IFU modules. Ideal correction is carried out by a deformable mirror on the VLT, using four laser guide stars, along with a natural star for adjusting the position. All guide stars are situated outside the main scientific field of view to reduce extra light interference. The only additional optics within the scientific area is a specialized Na notch filter, minimizing transmission loss compared to traditional adaptive optics systems. This advanced adaptive system is part of the overall VLT facility, with MUSE's specific part called GALACSI. The narrow-field mode of MUSE employs a special optical system to adjust the spatial sampling from 0.2 arcsec to 0.025 arcsec, effectively reducing the view to 7.5 × 7.5 arcsec. The most significant difference lies in adaptive optics coordination (with guide stars located closer) and the tip/tilt, which occurs at infrared wavelengths using either a natural guide star in the view area or the object itself. In such a setup, the adaptive optics are expected to produce an image limited by diffraction, with a Strehl ratio of 5% (targeting 10%) at 0.75 µm.\")\n",

The calibration was necessary because NACO does not provide arc lamp spectra for the L- and M-bands, so instead, we used atmospheric emission and absorption features as a wavelength reference. The curvature correction was made due to the variation in atmospheric refraction across the wide wavelength range, which we adjusted by shifting the pixel positions based on an atmospheric refraction formula. Following this, we applied optimum extraction techniques instead of aperture extraction to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. To mitigate slit losses at shorter wavelengths, we merged the extracted L- and M-band spectra—proved across different nights—with selected object's spectra taken at low airmasses in the JHK wavelength region.

      "this is row Pandas(file_1=\"One of the key historical uses of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has been their role as 'markers' for distant galaxies and proto-clusters. Powerful radio galaxies have long been used for this purpose due to their high visibility. It is believed, based on their placement in the K-band Hubble diagram, that these sources indicate the existence of large host galaxies. With sensitive Mid-Infrared (MIR) measurements from Spitzer, it is now possible to validate this belief using measurements of the H-band luminosity, which is less affected by AGN interference and can be easily adjusted for minor inaccuracies. These sources also help identify protoclusters at distances that other methods cannot reach. Multi-band photometry can facilitate the search for areas with a higher concentration of sources exhibiting characteristics like specific spectral energy distributions (SED) and/or Ly-alpha emission, which are expected of cluster members. Large Ly-alpha halos are commonly associated with these objects and provide insights into the sources of ionizing radiation and large-scale gas movements in galaxies during their early development. In addition to those around radio galaxies, Ly-alpha emission is also being observed around some quieter sources, particularly those detected at sub-millimeter wavelengths.\", file_2='A key historical role of AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) has been to serve as placeholders for distant galaxies and early clusters. Their high visibility has made powerful radio galaxies valuable in this respect. Based on where they appear on the K-band Hubble diagram, researchers suggest these objects signify large host galaxies. Recently, sensitive mid-infrared (MIR) data from Spitzer has allowed researchers to validate this idea by looking at H-band luminosity, which is mostly unaffected by AGN interference and has manageable correction factors. These AGN also help locate protoclusters at higher redshifts than other detection methods can reach. Multi-band photometry is then used to look for higher concentrations of sources that have traits, such as specific spectral energy distribution shapes or distinct Ly-alpha emissions, which are typical of ‘cluster’ members. Extended Ly_alpha halos seem to always surround these objects and offer insights into sources of ionizing radiation and large gas movements in long-evolving galaxies. Additionally, along with the emissions around radio galaxies, emissions of Ly-alpha radiation are now also observed in some less active sources, particularly those found at sub-mm sound levels.')\n",

      "this is row Pandas(file_1=\"Integral Field Spectroscopy  \\nAn integral field spectrograph (IFS) for planet imaging is difficult to develop but is viewed as a highly valuable tool for instruments searching for planets. This is because the IFS can be made with almost no differential distortions and its multiple spectral channels improve the correction of color variations in speckle and enable data-analysis methods that do not depend on pre-existing features in the planet's spectrum. For SPHERE, the focus is on a micro-lens-based IFS concept derived from the classic TIGER idea, adapted for high-contrast diffraction-limited observations. The project aims to achieve a 5-sigma detectivity at 0.5 arcseconds of \\\\(10^{-7}\\\\), with a goal to reach \\\\(10^{-8}\\\\) concerning the unblocked point spread function peak. The IFS operates within the Y-J bands (0.95 to 1.35 micrometers), using a single detection channel and allowing for simultaneous operation with IRDIS and IFS. It maintains a resolution of 30 per pixel, with a minimum field of view of 1.35 arcseconds square and an objective of 3 arcseconds square. Nyquist-limited spatial sampling at 0.95 micrometers is enforced similarly to IRDIS. Achieving consistency between IFS and IRDIS headers and other system components is a key aim. Thus, the same 2k by 2k detector format will be used, and it is likely the wavelength cutoff set for IRDIS will also be suitable for IFS. Details on the opto-mechanical design, such as the micro-lens array, collimation optics, an Amici Prism that produces no beam deviation while maintaining consistent resolution across the spectrum, camera optics, and the detector's cryostat, are provided.\", file_2=\"Integral Field Spectroscopy  \\nAn integral field spectrograph (IFS) for planet imaging is difficult to develop but is considered a very valuable tool for finding planets. This is due to two main reasons: First, the IFS can be created with almost no differences in image quality, and second, its multiple spectral channels improve the correction of light distortion and support analysis methods that don't depend on specific features being assumed in the planet’s spectrum. For the SPHERE project, we are working on a micro-lens-based IFS model that builds on the traditional TIGER design, adjusted for high-contrast observations. The system is aimed to achieve a 5 sigma detectivity at 0.5 arcseconds of 10^-7, with the target set at 10^-8 relative to the un-occulted point spread function peak. The IFS operates in the Y-J bands (0.95 to 1.35 micrometers), which allows it to use a single detection channel and work alongside IRDIS. It maintains a resolving power of 30 per pixel, with a minimum field of view of 1.35 arcseconds square and an aspirational goal of 3 arcseconds square. Spatial sampling at 0.95 micrometers follows Nyquist's limit, similar to IRDIS. Optimizing the compatibility between IFS and IRDIS in terms of the detector and related equipment is a key objective, so we are using the same 2k by 2k detector format, and it's likely that the long-wavelength cutoff set for IRDIS will also work for IFS. The design details include a micro-lens array, collimation optics, an Amici Prism that offers no beam deviation and consistent resolution across the wavelength range, camera optics, and the detector cryostat.\")\n",

This could also be accomplished using the Hubble Space Telescope or adaptive optics for OGLE-2005-BLG-169.

The initial call for ALMA proposals is anticipated around 2011. Several Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) modes, including various polarisation features with different total bandwidths, are expected to be implemented during the early science phase. The second correlator quadrant is scheduled for installation in 2009, while the third and fourth quadrants, which will allow support for up to 64 antennas, may be assembled by late 2010. Additional correlator configuration modes will be introduced in the future. An essential feature of ALMA is sub-arraying, which allows independent groups of antennas to operate in different modes. Implementing two sub-arrays initially is a top priority; for example, while one group of antennas maps a source, another can perform single-dish observations, or one sub-array could track a source while the other undertakes Commissioning. Each correlator quadrant may support multiple sub-arrays. The summed signals from two or more antennas will also be accessible in the correlator, facilitating the formation of a larger single antenna which, when combined with antennas situated on different continents, can achieve very high spatial resolution through a technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). This will require additional equipment at the AOS and will be exploited in the future. It will also be possible to support pulsar observations, contingent on the capability to implement pulsar period models and the alignment of ALMA's receiver bands with pulsar astrophysics. Moreover, due to the configuration of the ACA patch panel and the installation of the 16-antenna correlator next to the 64-antenna baseline correlator, the following benefits can be realized: (a) enhanced ALMA sensitivity by combining data from a total of 64 antennas; (b) efficient calibration of the 12 smaller 7-meter antennas through cross-correlation with the 12-meter antennas; and (c) easier comparison and cross-calibration of the performance of the ACA and baseline correlators.

Pulsar observations may also be possible if pulsar period models are implemented and if the ALMA receiver bands are relevant to pulsar astrophysics.

The largest stars in the Galaxy are usually found in a cluster of similar stars at the center of an OB cluster, such as the Orion Trapezium. Observing very young OB associations still forming reveals a significant molecular accretion flow toward the cluster center. Therefore, we anticipate the largest stars in the Galaxy to form at the centers of these large-scale accretion flows. The velocities of the accretion indicate that it occurs due to a 'cooperative accretion flow' influenced by the gravitational pull of multiple O stars at the cluster center. Within a few thousand astronomical units of the O stars, the molecular accretion flow becomes ionized but continues to move toward the cluster center since the escape velocity from the stars exceeds the sound speed in the ionized gas. The ionized flow forms an ionized accretion disk at the cluster center. The dust in the original molecular flow is destroyed by the high temperatures and densities in the disk, allowing accretion onto individual stars in the cluster without being hindered by strong radiation pressure on dust. Furthermore, within the fully ionized flow, there is no outward pressure from the hot ionized gas and the cold molecular gas to obstruct the flow. Thus, this large-scale cooperative accretion flow creates conditions that facilitate accretion onto very massive O stars despite the opposing forces of radiation and thermal pressure. A recent article reviews the observational evidence and additional physics regarding the upper stellar mass limit. Overall, the workshop raised more questions than answers, but it was successful due to the extensive and productive discussions. The two communities focused on star formation and star-cluster formation made progress in coming together, with optimism for collaboration in future research.\", file_2='A group attempted to address this question.

The consortium developing MICADO aims to create a straightforward and durable instrument that can address as much of the key NIR science as possible by the time the E-ELT begins operations. MICADO will function within the wavelength range of 0.8 to 2.5 µm and will have a field of view (FoV) of 53 × 53 arcseconds. The pixel size is 3 milliarcseconds (mas), while the point spread function (PSF) has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6 mas in the J-Band and 10 mas in the Ks-band. Key scientific objectives for the instrument include studying the Galactic Centre, examining the resolved stellar population beyond the Local Group, and investigating galaxy morphology in the distant Universe. The multi-conjugate adaptive optics module for the E-ELT is called MAORY, and Paolo Ciliegi presented the outcomes of PSF simulations. MAORY has a FoV of 150 arcseconds in diameter and can effectively meet the diffraction limit requirements of MICADO. Ciliegi noted that for a wide-field imager on the E-ELT with a target area of 5 × 5 arcminutes, GLAO technology would be needed, which shifts away from the diffraction-limited MCAO domain. Olivier Le Fevre demonstrated the wide-field imaging capabilities of OPTIMOS, which is designed for a 7 × 7 arcminute FoV, covering wavelengths from 0.37 to 1.4 µm, with 0.05-arcsecond pixels. This instrument mainly serves as a multi-object spectrometer that can employ up to 500 multi-slits in the optical and 170 in the NIR, expected to operate either in natural seeing or GLAO conditions.

Specifically, since the disks are used to transfer data, it is necessary for the machines in the mountains and those in Garching to have compatible disk slots and trays. Removing and installing disks is a frequent task, so the mechanics must work smoothly and reliably, and the parts need to be strong enough for numerous assembly and disassembly cycles. Additionally, the trays should be compact, efficient in cooling, and cost-effective. The disks arrive in their trays and are then installed in a different machine, so the slots must be fully compatible. To ensure better oversight on these details, we opted for a computer selection process that specifies individual computer parts instead of a complete model. All parts are standard and readily available from numerous suppliers. The new ESO data center accommodates a 24-machine NGAS cluster.

strong focus on measuring the Galactic Centre using infrared interferometers like the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), and comparing these to other low-luminosity galactic nuclei. Infrared interferometry has begun with observations of the bright dust-covered star IRS 3 using MIDI at the VLTI. In 2005, we collected data on the UT3–UT4 (6 meters) and UT1–UT4 (130 meters) baselines. We plotted measured visibilities along with a two-component model, where the inner component has a size of 20 milliarcseconds (160 astronomical units) and the outer component has a size of 50 milliarcseconds (400 astronomical units). The wavelength-dependent flux density ratios of the two components allow us to estimate blackbody temperatures, yielding 90 ± 100 Kelvin for the hotter inner component and 510 ± 50 Kelvin for the cooler outer component. This supports the idea that IRS 3 is a bright compact object in a heavy dust-forming phase and suggests that such sources may significantly add to the dust in the Galactic Centre. Although many other mid-infrared bright sources in the Galactic Centre, like IRS 1W, 2, 8, 9, 10, and 13W, are more spread out and currently undetected by MIDI, we recently successfully obtained fringes for the compact supergiant IRS 7 in the N-band with MIDI on the UT2–UT3 (47 meters) and in the K-band with AMBER on UT1–UT3 (10 meters) and UT3–UT4 (6 meters). The compact nature of IRS 7 is particularly important as it can act as a fringe tracker in future experiments at longer near-infrared/mid-infrared wavelengths. AMBER observations will be well-suited for studying apparent and physical binaries in the Galactic Centre (1 milliarcsecond is about 8 astronomical units). A detailed analysis of the diffuse emission and dust-covered sources at the Galactic Centre is crucial for understanding the interstellar medium in the central parsec.')\n",

Consequently, the ALMA management and scientists were tasked with creating a new project plan that fit within the available budget while still achieving the main scientific goals. During this time, extensive studies and efforts were made to outline the revised ALMA project. A significant cost-cutting measure was reducing the number of antennas from sixty-four to fifty, with an eventual aim of reaching sixty-four again. Tests for the receiver cartridge indicated that several receivers exceeded their noise temperature requirements, which helped to alleviate the impact on sensitivity from having fewer antennas. Independent advisory committees confirmed the scientific value of the modified ALMA project with its new, lower costs. By the end of 2005, the revised project plan and budget were endorsed by the ESO Council. The North American partners received approval from the NSF by mid-2006. Meanwhile, Japan, represented by the National Astronomy Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), worked on finalizing its involvement in ALMA. The European and North American partners collaborated closely with their Japanese counterparts to clarify Japan's role and reviewed several subsystems, including correlators, receivers, and antennas. The terms of the partnerships were established, leading to a trilateral agreement signed in summer 2006 between ESO, NSF, and Japan's National Institute for Natural Sciences (NINS). NAOJ will supply four twelve-meter antennas, twelve seven-meter antennas, two receiver bands for all sixty-six ALMA antennas, and the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) Correlator. Funding approval for Japan’s participation was also necessary. With Japan's involvement, ALMA became a truly global astronomy facility.\")\n",

To achieve these objectives, the signals from the ALMA antennas must be processed and sent to the technical building in a format suitable for the correlator. The ALMA Back-End ensures this is done in a reliable, lossless, and flexible manner. This overview describes the ALMA Back-End subsystems created by various European Institutes under ESO's guidance. Each antenna captures signals at frequencies up to 950 GHz, converting them into two Intermediate Frequency (IF) signals—one for each polarization—ranging from 4–12 GHz using cryogenic receivers. These signals are then digitized and sent to the technical building as a 120 Gbit/second raw data stream through a single optical fiber. Illustrations of the fiber network at Chajnantor are shown in Figure 1. In the technical building (on the right side of Figure 2), a special processor called the correlator combines the signals from superconducting antennas and preprocesses the data before it is forwarded to the computing system for additional processing.  The IF signal processing and digitization at the antennas, along with the data transmission system to the correlator, are elements of the ALMA Back-End subsystem (shown on the left side of Figure 2). The difficult environmental conditions at 5000 m altitude necessitate urgent consideration, as heat dissipation is significantly limited, in addition to challenges posed by remote location and low oxygen levels which affect the ability to conduct maintenance. This underscores the need for devices that feature low power consumption, high reliability, and straightforward maintenance. While cutting-edge information and communication technologies are increasingly aligning with ALMA’s needs, addressing these requirements involved advancements in technology beyond current industry standards, leading to the development of specific Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to tackle cases where the commercial solutions are inadequate. The Back-End additionally comprises a photonics local oscillator that supplies remarkably phase-accurate signals to all antennas.\", file_2=\"The ALMA Back-End  \\nThe Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is built to create high-quality images of spectral lines and continuum, allowing it to detect distant galaxies similar to the Milky Way and image forming stellar discs in nearby molecular clouds.

The ALMA Back-End does this in a way that is reliable, flexible, and without data loss. This document provides an overview of the ALMA Back-End subsystems developed by various European Institutes under the coordination of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). Each antenna captures signals with frequencies up to 950 GHz, which are then converted by the Front-End cryogenic receivers into two Intermediate Frequency (IF) signals, one for each polarization, within the range of 4–12 GHz. These signals are digitized and sent to the technical building as a 120 Gbit/second raw data stream through a single optical fiber. Figure 1 illustrates the fiber network at Chajnantor. Inside the technical building (shown on the right side of Figure 2), a custom processor known as the correlator cross-correlates the signals from all antennas and pre-processes the data before relaying it to the computing system for further analysis. The IF signal processing, digitization at the antennas, and the data transmission system leading to the correlator are all components of the ALMA Back-End subsystem (depicted on the left side of Figure 2). The challenging environment requires special consideration; at an altitude of 5000 m, heat dissipation is significantly limited, and the remote location along with low oxygen levels complicates on-site maintenance. This necessitates equipment that consumes low power, is highly reliable, and is easy to maintain. While advanced information and communication technologies are approaching ALMA's needs, fulfilling those requirements necessitated pushing technology beyond current standards, leading to the development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) where commercial options do not yet exist. The Back-End also features a photonics Local Oscillator that delivers an extremely phase-accurate signal to all antennas.\")\n",

The main strength of Spanish astronomy, its skilled workforce, is in good condition, with new generations of talented and eager astronomers being brought in. One of the main challenges now is to integrate these newcomers into the research and development system. Operating and maintaining the GTC remains a top priority for Spain. There are many ideas for second-generation scientific instruments to accompany EMIR, which will be the first operational near-infrared multi-object spectrometer. FRIDA, which will use the adaptive-optics facility at the GTC, is among the top proposals. Spain aims for the GTC to be a leading facility in the era of the ELTs. Alongside the GTC, smaller optical telescopes will also be important for balanced development, as they can perform certain observing programs more efficiently than larger telescopes and will need to be outfitted with the right instruments. Luckily, Spain has access to several telescopes in the 2–4-meter class. Future ground-based astronomy infrastructure will require investments totaling around a billion Euros. By joining ESO, Spain reaffirms its commitment to the ALMA project and will actively contribute to the realization of the European ELT.

      "this is row Pandas(file_1='Recent experiments have increased the estimated amount of baryonic matter in the Universe, which has resulted in updated amounts of deuterium, helium, and lithium formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. This new data shows that more lithium was produced than previously believed, leading to a concerning discrepancy of about two times or more compared to the commonly measured abundance in stars on the Spite plateau. Now, taking atomic diffusion into account, the amounts of lithium found in stars align well with the primordial lithium levels. We also observe the effects of atomic diffusion in lithium levels in turnoff and SGB stars, where a specific rise observed in SGB stars supports the diffusion model. This research makes the Spite plateau even more intriguing, as it has a cosmological origin but is uniformly decreased by physical processes in stars. This theoretical idea has existed for decades but did not gain traction among observers until recent diffusion models made this uniform decrease seem plausible, while also helping to constrain primordial lithium levels. Atomic diffusion might resolve the issue of lithium abundance in cosmology, but we note that other factors may also be important. This work emphasizes three methodological points: the potential of new multi-object spectrometers at large telescopes, the value of a consistent analysis of all relevant factors, and the advantages of refining physical models for greater self-consistency. The finding that atomic diffusion influences the chemical abundances in old, unevolved stars and that models can accommodate its effects is important and has several implications. Currently, turbulent mixing is included in an ad-hoc way without explaining its underlying physics. Similarly, we overlook the spectral impacts of thermal inhomogeneities and the three-dimensional nature of convection in our standard one-dimensional analysis. Therefore, much work remains to be done before the quality of current observational data aligns with the physical models of stars, allowing us to fully interpret the chemical element signatures in stellar spectra.', file_2='Recent experiments that revised the amount of baryonic matter in the Universe have changed our understanding of deuterium, helium, and lithium formed during Big-Bang nucleosynthesis. New findings indicate that more lithium was produced in the Big Bang than previously known, leading to a notable discrepancy of about two times or more compared to the usual measurements in stars on the Spite plateau. After considering atomic diffusion, we now see that outstanding stellar lithium amounts align well with primordial levels. Additionally, the influence of atomic diffusion on lithium in various star types has been noted, such as the rise in modeling associated with a specific suggestion from the diffusion model in turnoff and subgiant branch stars.

      "this is row Pandas(file_1='Early-type galaxies found in clusters show a clear relationship between their color and brightness, known as the red sequence. Different red sequences have been identified for clusters up to a redshift of 1.5, suggesting that there are many passively evolving galaxies whose star formation stopped long before they were observed. However, not all red sequence galaxies today were red and inactive in the distant past. Evidence indicates a downsizing effect in how red sequences developed in clusters: generally, the most massive and luminous galaxies ceased star formation and entered the red sequence earlier than their less massive counterparts. This has been shown using EDisCS data through various methods. The change in the ratio of bright to faint red galaxies indicates a shortage of faint red galaxies in distant clusters compared to those nearby. Supporting this, the brightness distribution of red galaxies aligns with passive evolution for the bright galaxies but shows a significant increase in faint galaxies as redshift decreases. Compared to bright red galaxies, there are more faint red galaxies in the general field than in clusters at redshifts of 0.6–0.8, but fewer at 0.4–0.6. This difference in evolutionary rates suggests that cluster environments are more effective than field environments in increasing the number of galaxies in the red sequence at redshifts less than 1. Additionally, an analysis of spectral line indices, which reveals stellar population ages, metallicities, and α-element enhancements, shows that massive red galaxies follow passive evolution with early formation times, while less massive galaxies require longer star formation histories. Even the Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs), the most massive galaxies, follow the downsizing pattern: their color evolution and K-band luminosity suggests they formed at redshifts greater than 2 and then evolved passively. Contrary to earlier studies, BCGs in EDisCS clusters have not shown significant changes in stellar mass since redshift 1. Clusters with higher velocity dispersions and masses tend to host brighter and more massive BCGs, but this relationship is weak, with the stellar mass of BCGs changing by only 70% across a broad range of cluster masses.', file_2='Early-type galaxies found in clusters show a clear link between their color and brightness, labeled the red sequence. Structures up to redshift 1.5 have distinct red sequences, suggesting many galaxies stopped forming stars long before we observed them. However, not all current red sequence galaxies have remained red and inactive since high redshift. Evidence points to a downsizing trend: more massive and brighter galaxies ceased star formation earlier than their smaller counterparts. This has been demonstrated through EDisCS data in multiple ways. The changing ratio of bright to faint red galaxies reveals a shortage of faint red galaxies in distant clusters versus nearby ones. Similarly, the bright red galaxies\\' luminosity function aligns with passive evolution but increasingly builds up low-brightness as distances improve. At redshifts between 0.6 and 0.8, fields host more faint red galaxies than clusters, contrasted by fewer offres outlines between 0.4ҙанBart Dir tk aeurni headersenee游clature superconductinggold

Both are located approximately 87 million light-years away in the constellation Libra. Last year, a star exploded near the hook shape formed between the two galaxies. The explosion, identified as SN 2005cf, was discovered by astronomers using the robotic KAIT telescope on May 8, making it the 84th supernova found that year. It appeared to be positioned on a bridge of matter linking MCG-01-39-003 and NGC 5917. Further observations with the Whipple Observatory 1.5-m Telescope confirmed that this supernova is of Type Ia and that the material was expelled at speeds reaching 15,000 km/s. Shortly after the discovery, the European Supernova Collaboration initiated a detailed observational campaign, utilizing numerous telescopes globally. There is evidence suggesting that interactions between galaxies may enhance star formation. As a result, the number of supernovae in these systems is expected to exceed that of isolated galaxies. Typically, this environment would primarily favor the explosions of young, massive stars. However, recent research indicates that such interactions could also raise the number of stars that eventually become Type Ia supernovae. The ESC team monitored the supernova from about ten days before it reached its peak brightness until over a year post-explosion. As the supernova dims, increasingly larger telescopes are required for observation. One year after the explosion, it is approximately 700 times fainter than at its peak. The supernova was observed with the VLT using the FORS1 instrument by ESO astronomer Ferdinando Patat, and later by the Paranal Science Team, focusing on the late phases of the event. These later stages are crucial for examining the inner regions of the ejected material, which helps in understanding the explosion mechanism and the elements formed during the explosion. High-resolution FORS1 images reveal a striking tidal structure shaped like a hook, which likely includes areas of star formation triggered by the galaxies' close encounter. ESO PR Photo 06 is a composite image generated from data collected with the FORS1 multi-mode instrument in April and May 2006 for the European Supernova Collaboration. The observations were conducted using four different filters (B, V, R, and I) that were combined to create a color image. The field of view is 5.6 × 8.3 arcminutes. North is oriented upward and East to the left. The observations were carried out by Ferdinando Patat and the Paranal Science Team, with the final processing completed by Olivia Blanche-main, Henri Boffin, and Hans Hermann Heyer.\", file_2='A Supernova in an Interacting Galaxy Pair  \\nMCG-01-39-003 is an unusual spiral galaxy that appears to be interacting with its neighboring spiral galaxy, NGC 5917. Both galaxies are located approximately 87 million light-years away in the constellation Libra. Last year, a star exploding nearby resulted in the discovery of the supernova designated SN 2005cf, which was noted as the 84th supernova found in 2005. It was identified by astronomers using the robotic KAIT telescope on May 8, with its position appearing on a stream of debris linking MCG-01-39-003 and NGC 5917. Further observations with the Whipple Observatory\\'s 1.5-meter Telescope confirmed that the supernova is of Type Ia and that the expansion material reached speeds of up to 15,000 km/s. Shortly after the discovery, the European Supernova Collaboration began an extensive observational campaign on this object, utilizing several telescopes worldwide. There have been indications that galaxies encountering each other can spur increased star formation. Consequently, these cases are expected to have more supernovae compared to isolated galaxies, with young, massive stars typically fueling predominantly such phenomena. However, recent research indicates these interactions might also explode more stars as Type Ia supernovae. The ESC team monitored this supernova comprehensively throughout its evolution, commencing about ten days before it peaked in brightness up until over a year after the blast. As the supernova dims, increasingly larger telescopes are necessary for observations. A year following the explosion, the supernova\\'s brightness has reduced by about 700 times in comparison to its peak. The event was observed using the VLT with gym FORS1 by ESO astronomer Ferdinando Patat and subsequently by the Paranal Science team to investigate the very late phases of the explosion. These later stages are critical to examining the ejected matter\\'s interior, enhancing the insight into the explosion process and the elements resultant from it.

      "this is row Pandas(file_1=\"The VLT/FLAMES system with fiber optics to the Giraffe and UVES spectrographs has transformed spectroscopic research on resolved star populations in nearby galaxies. Its operational modes, sensitivity, and field of view align closely with the needs to study Galactic dSph galaxies. For instance, it is now feasible to measure the abundance of many elements in nearby galaxies for over 100 stars within a 25-diameter field in a single observation. This marks a significant enhancement over earlier, challenging methods using single-slit spectrographs, which could only observe a few stars per galaxy. The DART Large Programme has collected abundance and velocity data for several hundred individual stars across four nearby dSph galaxies: Sculptor, Fornax, Sextans, and Carina. We utilized the VLT/FLAMES facility in low-resolution mode (LR 8, R ~ 8000) to obtain metallicity estimates from the Ca II triplet and precise radial velocity measurements across extensive areas in Sculptor, Fornax, and Sextans, extending to the tidal radius. Figure 1 illustrates the region surrounding the Sculptor dSph galaxy. The large ellipse indicates Sculptor's tidal radius, as determined by Irwin and Hatzidimitriou. The positions observed with VLT/FLAMES are shown as circles, with solid circles marking the 10 analyzed FLAMES pointings and dashed circles representing five additional fields observed in November 2005. The analyzed fields also display the locations of probable member stars (small red squares) and non-members (black crosses). Each of the four galaxies was also examined at high resolution (Giraffe settings HR 10, 1, and 1) in the central region to derive detailed abundances for several key elements, such as Mg, Ca, O, Ti, Na, and Eu for about 100 stars. During the Giraffe high-resolution observations, we also used the fiber feed to the UVES spectrograph to achieve broader wavelength coverage and higher resolution for a sample of seven to ten stars per galaxy. The comparison of results from UVES spectroscopy (R ~ 10000) and Giraffe spectroscopy (R ~ 20000) for the same stars is beneficial in affirming that reliable results can be obtained with lower resolution spectra than previously considered feasible or advisable. This lower resolution presents fewer issues at lower metallicity (e.g., Sculptor) compared to higher metallicity (e.g., Fornax).\", file_2='The VLT/FLAMES, with fibre optics linked to the Giraffe and
