## üõ† How to Use

The code for each challenge is contained within its respective directory. Most of the Python solutions can be run directly, while the Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) can be opened and run using Jupyter or Google Colab.

Please note that some file paths in the notebooks may be hardcoded. You may need to update these paths to point to the location of the data on your own machine.

## ü§ù Contributing

I'm always open to collaboration and suggestions! If you have a different approach to solving one of these problems or want to add your own solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
